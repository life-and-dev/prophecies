# About This Project

My journey with faith has been anything but conventional. From atheism to exploring various Christian traditions including megachurches to house churches with involvement in various traditional protestants, charismatic and messianic congregations. I've spent years asking questions about God, the Bible, and what it truly means to follow Christ.

## A Journey Through Prophecy

Throughout this journey, I've become increasingly fascinated by biblical prophecy. Not just as proof texts, but as genuine historical predictions that can be examined, verified, and understood. Questions kept arising: Which prophecies have truly been fulfilled? Which ones remain outstanding? How can we distinguish credible prophetic claims from wishful interpretation?

These questions led me deep into studying the prophecies of God through the lens of history, ancient texts, and apostolic testimony. I discovered that prophecy is not merely religious rhetoric but testable evidence that can strengthen or challenge faith.

This website is the fruit of that systematic exploration. The purpose here is to **categorize and identify credible prophecies** and to **explore why some prophecies remain unfulfilled**.

### The Heart Behind This Website

I want to help fellow seekers—believers and skeptics alike—examine biblical prophecy with intellectual honesty. This website provides:

- **Systematic categorization** of prophecies into messianic, trinitarian, end times, and world events
- **Multi-perspective evaluation** using historians, Tanakh (Old Testament), and apostolic witnesses
- **Honest assessment** of both fulfilled and unfulfilled prophecies
- **Transparent methodology** for determining prophetic credibility

You'll find here careful attention to [biblical texts](https://word.ofgod.info), rigorous examination of historical evidence, and honest wrestling with difficult questions. Some prophecies clearly demonstrate divine foreknowledge. Others require careful interpretation or remain unfulfilled. This website explores both categories without bias.

### Full Transparency

I write independently, not affiliated with any church or organization, and without sponsorship. This freedom allows me to follow where God's word leads without institutional constraints.

I encourage you to critically evaluate everything you read. Not just on this website, but always pray about any Christian content from any source you receive. I admit that I have been [wrong before](disclaimer.md), and I'll likely make more mistakes. That's why I genuinely invite you to [correct my errors](edit.md) when you spot them. Your wisdom, your insights, and your questions make this a richer resource for everyone who visits.

### An Invitation to Explore

Rather than asking you to accept my conclusions, I invite you to examine the evidence for yourself. The content here is designed to present prophecies systematically, evaluate them honestly, and provide tools for your own investigation.

As you explore this site, I encourage you to:
- Examine the historical evidence alongside the biblical texts
- Compare the three perspectives (Historians, Tanakh, Apostles) for each prophecy
- Question interpretations that seem forced or require excessive explanation
- Consider both fulfilled and unfulfilled prophecies with equal scrutiny
- Form your own conclusions about prophetic credibility

Whether you read one prophecy or explore the entire collection, my hope is that this systematic approach helps you understand which prophecies demonstrate genuine divine foreknowledge and why some remain outstanding.

Join me in this journey of discovery, exploring together the evidence for God's sovereignty over time through biblical prophecy.
