# Christian Prophecies

- To Christians, he is the Christ, [the Son of God](https://son.ofgod.info), the savior of the world
- To Muslims, he is a revered prophet, born of a virgin, but not God's Son
- To Jews, he was a teacher who didn't fulfill messianic prophecies
- To secularists, he was perhaps a wise moral teacher, but nothing more

According to the Bible, God made several promises about the Christ.

If Jesus is the Christ, it changes everything. How we understand God, ourselves, history, and our eternal destiny.

These propehcies prove that Jesus was the promised Christ (Messiah). Jews either does not consider it as a messianic prophecy. They often attribute the prophecy to another entity like the nation Israel in general or another king. The Tanakh (Old Testament) also do not confirm these prophecies because it was written before the Christ was born.
