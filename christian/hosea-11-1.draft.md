# Out of Egypt

The Old Testament contains passages that New Testament authors cite as prophecies fulfilled in Jesus Christ. But what happens when a verse, deeply rooted in Israel's history, is applied to the Messiah? This article explores Hosea 11:1, a verse about the Exodus, and delves into how Matthew's Gospel uses it, sparking a centuries-long debate between Jewish and Christian interpretations.

The prophet Hosea wrote about God's relationship with Israel:

> When Israel was a child, I loved him, and **out of Egypt I called my son**. — Hosea 11:1 (ESV)

The broader context makes clear this is about Israel's exodus from Egypt:

> When Israel was a child, I loved him, and out of Egypt I called my son. The more they were called, the more they went away; they kept sacrificing to the Baals and burning offerings to idols. Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk; I took them up by their arms, but they did not know that I healed them. I led them with cords of kindness, with the bands of love, and I became to them as one who eases the yoke on their jaws, and I bent down to them and fed them. — Hosea 11:1-4 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

The Gospel of Matthew applies this verse to Jesus' return from Egypt as a child:

> Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, "Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him." And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt and remained there until the death of Herod. **This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, "Out of Egypt I called my son."** — Matthew 2:13-15 (ESV)

Matthew claims Jesus' return from Egypt fulfilled Hosea 11:1, even though the original context clearly refers to Israel's exodus under Moses.

### Jews

Hosea 11:1 is universally recognized by Jewish scholars as referring to the historical exodus of Israel from Egypt, not a messianic prophecy.

Jewish objections include:

1. **Clear historical context.** The verse explicitly states "When Israel was a child" and refers to the exodus event approximately 700 years before Hosea wrote. This is historical narrative, not future prophecy.

2. **"My son" refers to Israel.** Throughout the Old Testament, Israel is called God's "son" (Exodus 4:22-23: "Israel is my firstborn son"; Deuteronomy 14:1; Isaiah 1:2; Jeremiah 31:9). The phrase "out of Egypt I called my son" clearly refers to the nation of Israel being delivered from Egyptian slavery.

3. **Continuous context contradicts Jesus.** Hosea 11:2-4 (ESV) describes Israel's rebellion immediately after the exodus: "The more they were called, the more they went away; they kept sacrificing to the Baals." This describes Israel's idolatry, not Jesus' life.

4. **Prophetic past tense.** Hosea uses past tense ("I loved him," "I called") referring to a completed historical event, not future prophecy. This is prophetic reflection on history, not prediction.

5. **Matthew's methodology questioned.** Jews argue Matthew is taking a verse completely out of context and applying it to Jesus without justification. The verse says nothing about a messiah or a future child returning from Egypt.

### Christian

Christians offer several interpretive frameworks to explain Matthew's use of Hosea 11:1.

#### Typological Fulfillment, Not Direct Prophecy

Christians argue Matthew is using "typological fulfillment" or "prophetic pattern." An Old Testament person or event (the "type") foreshadows a New Testament reality (the "antitype"). In this case, Israel's exodus from Egypt is the type and Jesus' return from Egypt is the greater antitype.

The Greek word Matthew uses (πληρόω, *plēroō*) can mean "fulfill," but it can also mean "fill full" or "bring to full meaning." Matthew may be saying Jesus "fills full" the meaning of Israel's story, not that Hosea predicted a future event.

Christians argue Jesus recapitulates Israel's story perfectly:
- Israel was called out of Egypt → Jesus was called out of Egypt
- Israel tested in wilderness 40 years → Jesus tested in wilderness 40 days
- Israel failed the test → Jesus succeeded where Israel failed
- Israel was God's corporate "son" → Jesus is God's ultimate "Son"

Paul uses similar typology with Adam ("The first man Adam... the last Adam," 1 Corinthians 15:45, ESV). Jesus fulfills what Adam failed to do, though Genesis is not a prediction of Jesus.

#### Dual Referent (Corporate and Individual)

Some Christians argue "my son" has a dual referent. It refers to Israel corporately and to Messiah individually. Just as "seed" in Genesis 22:18 (ESV) can mean both many descendants and one specific descendant (Christ), "son" can mean both Israel and Jesus.

In ancient Near Eastern thought, the king embodied the nation. If Messiah is the true King of Israel, he represents Israel perfectly, so what is said of Israel can apply to him.

While Hosea 11:1 looks backward historically, other parts of Hosea look forward to restoration (Hosea 3:4-5, 11:10-11, ESV). Christians argue Matthew sees Jesus as the one who brings that restoration by perfectly fulfilling Israel's calling.

#### Matthew's Inspired Hermeneutic

Christians who hold to the doctrine of biblical inspiration argue that Matthew, writing under the Holy Spirit's guidance, had authority to reveal deeper meanings in Old Testament texts that the original human author may not have fully understood.

1 Peter 1:10-12 (ESV) states that Old Testament prophets themselves "searched and inquired carefully" about the salvation they prophesied, not fully understanding the timing or details. Christians argue the Holy Spirit can intend multiple layers of meaning.

Jesus interpreted the Old Testament messianically in ways that were not obvious (Luke 24:27, 44-45, ESV: "beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself"). Matthew follows Jesus' approach.

#### Narrative Parallelism, Not Predictive Prophecy

Some Christians acknowledge Hosea 11:1 is not a direct prediction but argue Matthew is showing Jesus' life parallels Israel's story. This does not require Hosea to have intended a messianic prediction. Matthew is demonstrating theological continuity.

Matthew's Gospel emphasizes Jesus as the new Moses (Sermon on the Mount parallels Sinai, etc.). The Egypt connection reinforces this theme. Just as Moses led Israel out of Egypt, Jesus, the greater Moses, comes out of Egypt to lead a new exodus of spiritual deliverance.

Christians argue this is not misapplying Scripture but showing how Jesus' life embodies Israel's story and brings it to its intended climax. It is a literary-theological connection, not necessarily a claim that Hosea predicted this event.

#### Challenges Christians Acknowledge

Even many Christian scholars acknowledge this is one of the more difficult "fulfillment" citations in the New Testament. The historical context of Hosea 11:1 clearly refers to Israel's past exodus, and there is no indication Hosea intended a future messianic prediction.

The argument's strength depends on whether one accepts typological interpretation as valid. Jews typically do not accept this method. They require clear predictive prophecy.

Unlike prophecies with clear future predictions (e.g., Micah 5:2, ESV about Bethlehem), Hosea 11:1 will not convince someone Jesus is Messiah unless they first accept Matthew's apostolic authority and typological hermeneutic.

## Conclusion

Hosea 11:1 is a historical reference to Israel's exodus from Egypt, not a prediction of a future event. The verse uses the past tense and explicitly identifies Israel as "my son" in its immediate context.

The claim of "fulfillment" rests entirely on accepting [typological interpretation](#typological-fulfillment-not-direct-prophecy) and [apostolic authority](#matthews-inspired-hermeneutic) to reinterpret Old Testament texts messianically. While Christians see Jesus as the true Israel who perfectly fulfills what Israel was called to be, this passage illustrates the hermeneutical divide between Jewish and Christian interpretations.

Jews require clear, contextually-supported predictive prophecy, while Christians accept typological fulfillment where Jesus recapitulates Israel's story. This is not a straightforward prediction but a theological pattern Matthew identifies retrospectively under apostolic authority.
