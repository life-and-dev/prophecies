# Resurrection on the Third Day

The concept of a third-day resurrection is a cornerstone of Christian theology. While the New Testament clearly proclaims Jesus' resurrection on the third day, the Old Testament foundations for this belief are often debated. This article explores the prophetic significance of Hosea 6:2 and its connection to the resurrection of Jesus.

Hosea prophesied about Israel's restoration using "third day" language:

> Come, let us return to the LORD; for he has torn us, that he may heal us; he has struck us down, and he will bind us up. **After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will raise us up**, that we may live before him. — Hosea 6:1-2 (ESV)

The broader context shows this refers to Israel's call to repentance after judgment. The pronouns are plural ("us," "we"), clearly referring to Israel collectively, not one individual.

## Fulfillment

### Apostolic Understanding

> Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb... But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. **He is not here, for he has risen**, as he said." — Matthew 28:1, 5-6 (ESV)

Jesus rose on the third day:

- Crucified: Friday (Day 1)
- In tomb: Saturday (Day 2)
- Risen: Sunday (Day 3)

Jesus predicted His resurrection on the third day:

> And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and **after three days rise again**. — Mark 8:31 (ESV)

The apostolic teaching emphasizes this fulfillment:

> For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that **he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures**. — 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 (ESV)

Additional evidence from the New Testament:

- **Jesus predicted it** (Matthew 16:21, 17:23, 20:19): Foretold third day resurrection
- **Fulfilled** (Matthew 28:1-6): Rose on third day
- **Pattern in Scripture**: Third day significance (Genesis 22:4; Exodus 19:11,16)

### Jewish Interpretation

Hosea 6:1-3 is understood as Israel's call to repentance after judgment. The "two days" and "third day" are metaphorical language about Israel's restoration from exile. The pronouns are plural ("us," "we"), clearly referring to Israel collectively, not one individual. The "days" represent short, indefinite periods (eras in prophetic literature), not literal 24-hour days. This was fulfilled when Israel returned from Babylonian exile and rebuilt Jerusalem and the temple.

### Christian Interpretation

Christians offer several interpretive frameworks to explain how Jesus' third-day resurrection fulfills Scripture:

**Paul's Citation:**

Paul says Jesus "was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures" (1 Corinthians 15:4), indicating Old Testament basis for third-day resurrection expectation.

**Typological Fulfillment:**

While Hosea 6:2's immediate context is Israel's restoration, it establishes a pattern — restoration/resurrection on the third day. Jesus' resurrection fulfills this pattern at a higher level.

**Third Day Significance:**

The recurring third-day motif in Scripture points to divine vindication and new beginning:

- Isaac's deliverance on the third day (Genesis 22:4)
- Giving of Law on the third day (Exodus 19:11,16)

Jesus' resurrection consummates this pattern.

**Corporate and Individual:**

Just as Adam represented humanity and Israel represents God's people, Jesus represents and fulfills Israel's calling. What happened to Israel collectively (death in exile, restoration) happens to Jesus individually (death, resurrection), who then applies it to all believers.

## Conclusion

The resurrection of Jesus on the third day is a core belief in Christianity, with the [Apostolic understanding](#apostolic-understanding) affirming it was "in accordance with the Scriptures." The [Christian interpretation](#christian-interpretation) often views passages like Hosea 6:2 as a typological prophecy of this event. In contrast, the [Jewish interpretation](#jewish-interpretation) is that Hosea 6:2 refers to the restoration of Israel. Whether Hosea 6:2 is a prophecy of the resurrection is therefore a matter of theological interpretation.
