# Resurrection on the Third Day

The Old Testament contains many prophecies about the coming Messiah, but not all are direct predictions. Some are hidden in patterns and types, often leading to debate. One such passage is Hosea 6:2, which speaks of being raised on the "third day." But was this truly a prophecy of the Messiah's resurrection, or does it refer to something else entirely?

Hosea prophesied about Israel's restoration using "third day" language:

> Come, let us return to the LORD; for he has torn us, that he may heal us; he has struck us down, and he will bind us up. **After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will raise us up**, that we may live before him. — Hosea 6:1-2 (ESV)

The broader context shows this refers to Israel's call to repentance after judgment. The pronouns are plural ("us," "we"), clearly referring to Israel collectively, not one individual.

## Interpretations of Fulfillment

### Apostolic Witness to the Resurrection

The apostles testified that Jesus rose on the third day, in accordance with the Scriptures.

> Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb... But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. **He is not here, for he has risen**, as he said." — Matthew 28:1, 5-6 (ESV)

Jesus rose on the third day:

- Crucified: Friday (Day 1)
- In tomb: Saturday (Day 2)
- Risen: Sunday (Day 3)

Jesus predicted His resurrection on the third day:

> And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and **after three days rise again**. — Mark 8:31 (ESV)

The apostolic teaching emphasizes this fulfillment:

> For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures, that he was buried, that **he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures**. — 1 Corinthians 15:3-4 (ESV)

Additional evidence from the New Testament:

- **Jesus predicted it** (Matthew 16:21, 17:23, 20:19): Foretold third day resurrection
- **Fulfilled** (Matthew 28:1-6): Rose on third day
- **Pattern in Scripture**: Third day significance (Genesis 22:4; Exodus 19:11,16)

### Jewish Interpretation

The traditional [Jewish interpretation of Hosea 6:1–3](https://www.sefaria.org/Hosea.6.2?with=Talmud) is that it refers to Israel's repentance and restoration after a period of judgment. The terms "two days" and "third day" are seen as metaphorical, representing a short but indefinite period of exile before God's deliverance. This view is supported by the plural pronouns ("us," "we"), which point to a collective group—Israel—rather than a single individual. From this perspective, the prophecy was fulfilled when the Jewish people returned from the Babylonian exile to rebuild Jerusalem and the Second Temple.

### Christian Interpretation

In contrast, Christians have historically understood Hosea 6:2 as a typological prophecy of Jesus' resurrection. They interpret the passage in several ways, as [detailed in various commentaries](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/hosea/6-2.htm):

**Paul's Apostolic Proclamation**

The apostle Paul explicitly states that Jesus "was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures" (1 Corinthians 15:4), which suggests that the early church saw a clear Old Testament basis for this belief.

**Typological Fulfillment**

From a Christian perspective, Hosea 6:2 is not a direct, literal prediction but a typological one. While the immediate context refers to Israel's restoration, it establishes a recurring biblical pattern: divine deliverance and restoration occurring on the "third day." In this view, Jesus' resurrection is the ultimate fulfillment of this pattern, elevating it from a national, physical restoration to a universal, spiritual one.

**The "Third Day" Motif in Scripture**

The significance of the "third day" is a recurring theme throughout the Old Testament, often marking a moment of divine intervention, deliverance, or new beginnings. Examples include:

- Abraham's near-sacrifice of Isaac, which ends on the third day (Genesis 22:4)
- The giving of the Law at Mount Sinai on the third day (Exodus 19:11, 16)

Jesus' resurrection on the third day is seen as the culmination of this biblical motif, signifying God's ultimate act of salvation and the inauguration of a new covenant.

**Corporate and Individual Fulfillment**

Another layer of Christian interpretation is the idea that Jesus, as the Messiah, embodies and fulfills the destiny of Israel. In the same way that Adam represented all of humanity, Jesus represents the people of God. Therefore, what happened to Israel collectively—a symbolic "death" in exile followed by a "resurrection" or restoration—is fulfilled in Jesus individually and literally through His death and resurrection. This, in turn, is applied to all believers who are united with Him.

## Conclusion

The interpretation of Hosea 6:2 remains a key point of difference between Jewish and Christian theology. The [Jewish interpretation](#jewish-interpretation) views the passage as a metaphor for national restoration, while the [Christian interpretation](#christian-interpretation) sees it as a typological prophecy of the Messiah's resurrection.

While the apostles testified to the resurrection, and Paul affirmed it was "in accordance with the Scriptures," the debate ultimately hinges on whether one accepts typological fulfillment as a valid form of prophecy. The evidence from the "third day" motif in Scripture and the concept of corporate and individual fulfillment provide a strong basis for the Christian view, but the passage in Hosea, when read in isolation, does not offer a direct, unambiguous prediction of a third-day resurrection.
