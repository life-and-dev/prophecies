# Foundation Stone in Zion

> Therefore thus says the Lord GOD, "Behold, **I am the one who has laid as a foundation in Zion, a stone, a tested stone, a precious cornerstone, of a sure foundation**: 'Whoever believes will not be in haste.'" — Isaiah 28:16 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian

Christians believe this prophecy was fulfilled in Jesus Christ. The Apostle Paul explicitly applied this prophecy to Jesus and salvation through faith, contrasting it with righteousness based on the law.

> Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved... For, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness. For **Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes**.
>
> For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them. But the righteousness based on faith says... if **you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved**. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved. For the Scripture says, **"Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame."** — Romans 10:1, 3-11 (ESV)

The Apostle Peter also identified Jesus as the cornerstone, combining this prophecy with others to show that Jesus is both the foundation for believers and a stumbling block for unbelievers.

> For it stands in Scripture: **"Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame."** So the honor is for you who believe, but for those who do not believe, "The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone," and "A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense." They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do. — 1 Peter 2:6-8 (ESV)

Christians argue that the "stone" represents an individual Messiah because:

1.  **Divine Act:** God "lays" the stone, suggesting a specific divine intervention like sending Jesus.
2.  **Tested Character:** Jesus was "tested" through temptation and suffering, proving faithful.
3.  **Object of Faith:** "Whoever believes" implies a personal trust suited for a person rather than a city or object.
4.  **Dual Nature:** Jesus functions as both a foundation for salvation and a stone of judgment (stumbling), fitting the broader context of Isaiah (Isaiah 8:14).

### Jews

Isaiah 28:16 is generally not viewed by Jewish scholars as a direct messianic prophecy. The context of Isaiah 28 addresses the leaders of Ephraim (Northern Kingdom) and their false confidence.

Jewish interpretations typically identify the "cornerstone" as:
1.  **The Faithful Remnant:** The righteous community in Zion.
2.  **Jerusalem/The Temple:** The restored city or the physical temple foundation.
3.  **King Hezekiah:** A historical king of Judah.
4.  **The Torah:** The foundation of Jewish faith and practice.

From this perspective, "whoever believes" refers to trust in God's word, commandments, or His established order in Zion, rather than faith in a specific future messianic figure.

## Conclusion

**Christian fulfillment**

The New Testament authors Peter and Paul explicitly interpret this passage as referring to Jesus Christ. While the original context in Isaiah addresses the political situation of Judah and the Northern Kingdom, the apostolic interpretation sees Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of the "sure foundation" laid by God in Zion, a view not shared by Rabbinic tradition.
