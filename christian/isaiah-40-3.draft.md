# The Voice in the Wilderness

## Prophecy

> A voice cries: "In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD; make straight in the desert a highway for our God." — Isaiah 40:3 (ESV)

This passage is part of Isaiah's message of comfort to the Jewish people, though its specific meaning and fulfillment are understood differently by Jewish and Christian interpreters.

## Interpretations

### Jewish Interpretation

Jewish scholars understand Isaiah 40:3 within its immediate historical context of the [Babylonian exile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity). Isaiah chapters 40-55 (often called "[Deutero-Isaiah](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/isaiah-40-66-return-and-restoration/)" or "Second Isaiah") address the Jewish people during their captivity in Babylon (6th century BCE), offering comfort and promising imminent redemption.

The passage begins with words of consolation: "Comfort, comfort my people, says your God. Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and cry to her that her warfare is ended, that her iniquity is pardoned" (Isaiah 40:1-2). The "voice crying in the wilderness" announces God's preparation of a way for His exiled people to return home to Jerusalem. The "highway" metaphor represents the literal journey from Babylon back to the land of Israel.

[Targum Jonathan](https://www.sefaria.org/Targum_Jonathan_on_Isaiah.40), an ancient Aramaic translation and interpretation, renders the verse as: "A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way before the people of the Lord; cast up a highway in the plain before the congregation of our God." This emphasizes the people's return rather than the arrival of an individual messiah.

This interpretation aligns with the broader theme of Isaiah 40-55: a "new Exodus"—God leading His people out of captivity (Babylon) just as He led them out of Egypt centuries earlier. The prophet spoke these words as comfort to exiles wondering if God would keep His promises to Israel.

### Christian Interpretation

Christians believe this prophecy was fulfilled by **John the Baptist**, who prepared the way for Jesus' ministry. John lived in the wilderness of Judea, wore camel's hair, ate locusts and wild honey, and preached a baptism of repentance. All four Gospels explicitly identify John as this voice.

> For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.'" — Matthew 3:3 (ESV)

> As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight...'" — Luke 3:4 (ESV)

See also Mark 1:3 and John 1:23.

Christians view John's wilderness ministry as the spiritual preparation needed for people to receive Jesus as Messiah, understanding the prophecy as pointing forward beyond the Babylonian exile to a greater redemption through Christ.

## Conclusion

**Competing interpretations**

The core disagreement centers on the prophecy's intended timeframe and fulfillment:

The Jewish interpretation addresses the immediate historical context of Isaiah 40-55, which consistently speaks to exiles in Babylon about their imminent return to Jerusalem. The opening call to "comfort my people" (40:1-2) explicitly references the end of Jerusalem's "warfare" and the pardoning of her "iniquity," language that fits the exile context. The Targum's rendering supports this communal understanding—preparing a way for "the people of the Lord" to return home.

The Christian interpretation relies on the New Testament authors applying this passage to John the Baptist approximately 600 years after the Babylonian exile ended. While John's literal ministry in the wilderness creates a surface connection to the text, this reading requires understanding Isaiah's words as prophesying far beyond their immediate exile context to a future messianic forerunner.
