# Isaiah 40:3 (Voice in Wilderness)

The prophecy of Isaiah 40:3, which speaks of a voice crying out in the wilderness to prepare a divine path, stands as a pivotal verse in both Jewish and Christian traditions. While its historical context points to a message of hope for ancient Israelites in exile, its application in the New Testament has given it a distinctly messianic significance. This article explores the different interpretations of this prophecy, examining its meaning within its original Jewish context and its later identification with John the Baptist, who heralded the arrival of Jesus. By looking at both perspectives, we can better understand the enduring theological importance of this ancient call to "prepare the way of the LORD."

## Prophecy

> A voice cries: "In the wilderness prepare the way of the LORD; make straight in the desert a highway for our God." — Isaiah 40:3 (ESV)

This passage is part of Isaiah's message of comfort to the Jewish people, though its specific meaning and fulfillment are understood differently by Jewish and Christian interpreters.

## Interpretations

### Jewish Interpretation

Jewish scholars understand Isaiah 40:3 within its immediate historical context of the [Babylonian exile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Babylonian_captivity). Isaiah chapters 40-55 (often called "[Deutero-Isaiah](https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/isaiah-40-66-return-and-restoration/)" or "Second Isaiah") address the Jewish people during their captivity in Babylon (6th century BCE), offering comfort and promising imminent redemption.

The passage begins with words of consolation: "Comfort, comfort my people, says your God. Speak tenderly to Jerusalem, and cry to her that her warfare is ended, that her iniquity is pardoned" (Isaiah 40:1-2). The "voice crying in the wilderness" announces God's preparation of a way for His exiled people to return home to Jerusalem. The "highway" metaphor represents the literal journey from Babylon back to the land of Israel.

[Targum Jonathan](https://www.sefaria.org/Targum_Jonathan_on_Isaiah.40), an ancient Aramaic translation and interpretation, renders the verse as: "A voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye the way before the people of the Lord; cast up a highway in the plain before the congregation of our God." This emphasizes the people's return rather than the arrival of an individual messiah.

This interpretation aligns with the broader theme of Isaiah 40-55: a "new Exodus"—God leading His people out of captivity (Babylon) just as He led them out of Egypt centuries earlier. The prophet spoke these words as comfort to exiles wondering if God would keep His promises to Israel.

### Christian Interpretation

Christians believe this prophecy was fulfilled by **John the Baptist**, who prepared the way for Jesus' ministry. John lived in the wilderness of Judea, wore camel's hair, ate locusts and wild honey, and preached a baptism of repentance. All four Gospels explicitly identify John as this voice.

> For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.'" — Matthew 3:3 (ESV)

> As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the prophet, "The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight...'" — Luke 3:4 (ESV)

See also Mark 1:3 and John 1:23.

Christians view John's wilderness ministry as the spiritual preparation needed for people to receive Jesus as Messiah, understanding the prophecy as pointing forward beyond the Babylonian exile to a greater redemption through Christ.

## Conclusion

The prophecy in [Isaiah 40:3](#prophecy) presents two distinct paths of interpretation, each deeply rooted in its respective tradition.

The [Jewish interpretation](#jewish-interpretation) views the verse as a message of hope for the exiled Israelites, promising a divine rescue and a return to their homeland from Babylon. This reading is grounded in the historical context of Isaiah 40–55, where the prophet offers comfort to a displaced nation.

In contrast, the [Christian interpretation](#christian-interpretation) sees the prophecy fulfilled in the person of John the Baptist, who announced the coming of Jesus. The Gospels identify John as the "voice in the wilderness," preparing the way for a spiritual redemption that extends beyond the physical restoration of Israel.

Both views highlight the prophecy's enduring significance—one as a promise of return and the other as a foreshadowing of messianic salvation.
