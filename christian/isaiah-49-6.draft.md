# Light to the Nations

## Prophecy

Isaiah prophesied that the mission of God's servant would not be limited to the tribes of Jacob (Israel) but would extend to the whole world.

> "It is too light a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to bring back the preserved of Israel; I will make you as a **light for the nations**, that **my salvation may reach to the end of the earth**." — Isaiah 49:6 (ESV)

## Interpretations

### Jewish Interpretation

Jewish scholars identify the "servant" in Isaiah 49:3 as explicitly stated: "You are My servant, **Israel**, in whom I glory." Traditional commentators offer nuanced understandings:

[**Rashi** (1040-1105 CE)](https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/30225/in-isaiah-49-is-the-servant-the-messiah-or-is-he-israel) interprets the servant as either the prophet Isaiah himself or the nation of Israel, with verse 3 affirming Israel's role in glorifying God through perseverance amid dispersion. [**Ibn Ezra** (1089-1167 CE)](https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/30225/in-isaiah-49-is-the-servant-the-messiah-or-is-he-israel) views the servant's commissioning "from the womb" (verses 1-5) as emblematic of Israel's prophetic mission to gather and restore the people.

The ["light to nations" concept](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light_unto_the_nations) describes Israel's witness role. According to the Jewish Study Bible, "the nations of the world will witness God's faithfulness to the covenant when Israel is redeemed...the Israelites are a 'light' by virtue of what happens to them, not because of what they do." Israel serves as a testimony to God's power and faithfulness through their national restoration from exile.

Verse 5 presents an interpretive complexity: the servant's mission is "to bring Jacob back" and "gather Israel," which could suggest either (1) a righteous remnant within Israel restoring the whole nation, or (2) the prophet Isaiah's mission to call Israel back to faithfulness. The emphasis remains on Israel's national restoration, not individual messianic salvation extending beyond Israel.

Modern Jewish thought emphasizes [Israel's role as spiritual exemplars](https://aish.com/the-mission-of-the-jewish-people/)—being a "light" not through proselytizing but through demonstrating ethical monotheism and faithful community life.

### Christian Interpretation

Christians believe this prophecy was fulfilled through Jesus and the apostolic mission to the Gentiles. While Jesus' earthly ministry was primarily to "the lost sheep of the house of Israel," his death and resurrection opened salvation to all nations.

The Apostle Paul explicitly quoted this verse as his authority for turning to the Gentiles when Jews in Antioch Pisidia rejected the gospel:

> For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, "I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth." — Acts 13:47 (ESV)

Christians identify Jesus as the servant despite verse 3 calling the servant "Israel," interpreting this as a representative or typological usage—Jesus embodying Israel's mission perfectly. The early church's rapid spread among Gentiles represents, Christians believe, the prophesied extension of God's salvation to "the ends of the earth."

## Conclusion

**Competing interpretations**

**The Jewish interpretation** takes Isaiah 49:3's explicit identification seriously: "You are My servant, Israel." Traditional commentators (Rashi, Ibn Ezra) understand this as either the prophet Isaiah representing Israel's mission or the nation Israel itself serving as God's witness through their restoration from exile. Being a "light to nations" means demonstrating God's faithfulness through what happens to Israel—their redemption witnesses to God's covenant reliability. The mission described in verse 5 ("bring Jacob back...gather Israel") focuses on restoring the Jewish people, not extending salvation to Gentiles.

**The Christian interpretation** requires understanding "Israel" in verse 3 as pointing beyond the nation to an individual who perfectly embodies Israel's calling—Jesus Christ. Paul's application of verse 6 to the Gentile mission (Acts 13:47) reinterprets the prophecy's scope: instead of nations witnessing Israel's restoration, Paul sees active proclamation bringing salvation to Gentiles. This reading requires seeing Isaiah's words about national restoration as ultimately prophesying individual salvation through Christ extended globally.
