# The Messenger of Peace

## Prophecy

Isaiah celebrated the beauty of the one bringing the news of God's reign and salvation.

> "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of happiness, who publishes salvation..." — Isaiah 52:7 (ESV)

## Interpretations

### Jewish Interpretation

Jewish scholars understand [Isaiah 52:7 within the context of Israel's return from Babylonian exile](https://www.bethmelekh.com/yaakovs-commentary/isaiah-52-the-feet-of-him-who-brings-good-news). Isaiah 52 is a poem announcing the restoration of Jerusalem and the return of Jews from exile to the City of David, meant to inspire confidence that God would restore Jerusalem and her people.

The "beautiful feet" describe messengers running across distant hills toward Jerusalem, bringing the announcement of the exiles' certain return to their homeland. The beauty isn't about the messenger's physical appearance—the passage quickly shifts focus from the "feet" to the message's content: "peace … good news … salvation … 'Your God reigns!'" The word "beautiful" carries the idea of "full bloom" or "mature development," emphasizing the rapid, vigorous approach of the messenger bringing joyful news.

Ancient Jewish interpretations varied. The [Pesikta of Rav Kahana includes extended interpretations](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/isaiah/52-7.htm) of the messenger bringing "good news," with some identifying this as Isaiah himself, others as the returned exiles of Israel in the era of redemption, and some interpreting it of the future Messiah. The Targum Jonathan and Rabbi Moses Haddarschan also applied it messianically to the age of redemption.

The good news proclaimed is "Your God reigns!"—affirming God's sovereignty and faithfulness in restoring His exiled people to Jerusalem, fulfilling His covenant promises despite judgment.

### Christian Interpretation

Christians believe this prophecy found renewed application in the gospel message. The Apostle Paul quotes this passage in Romans 10:15 ("How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!") to describe the apostolic mission of preaching the Gospel (which literally means "good news") of Jesus Christ to the world.

Christians interpret the "good news" as the message of peace with God through Jesus Christ, extending beyond Israel's physical restoration to spiritual redemption available to all nations.

## Conclusion

**Competing interpretations**

**The Jewish interpretation** addresses Isaiah 52's immediate exile context. The chapter announces Jerusalem's restoration and the return of exiles—messengers bringing news that God has redeemed His people and they can return home. "Your God reigns!" proclaims God's sovereignty demonstrated through keeping His covenant promises to restore Israel from Babylonian captivity. Ancient Jewish sources understood this as either a historical announcement of the exile's end or a future messianic redemption of Israel.

**The Christian interpretation** sees Paul spiritualizing Isaiah's physical restoration imagery to describe gospel proclamation. Instead of messengers announcing Israel's physical return to Jerusalem, Paul applies the "beautiful feet" to preachers announcing spiritual salvation through Christ to all nations. This interpretation requires seeing Isaiah's words about Jerusalem's restoration as ultimately pointing to a broader spiritual message beyond its original exile-return context.
