# Isaiah 52:7 (Messenger of Peace)

Isaiah 52:7, with its imagery of a messenger bringing good news, is a pivotal Old Testament verse. While deeply rooted in the history of Israel's exile, its meaning has been a subject of rich interpretation. This article explores its significance within both its original Jewish context and its later application in Christian thought.

## Prophecy

Isaiah celebrated the beauty of the one bringing the news of God's reign and salvation.

> "How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of happiness, who publishes salvation..." — Isaiah 52:7 (ESV)

## Interpretations

### Jewish Interpretation

Jewish scholars understand [Isaiah 52:7 within the context of Israel's return from Babylonian exile](https://www.bethmelekh.com/yaakovs-commentary/isaiah-52-the-feet-of-him-who-brings-good-news). Isaiah 52 is a poem announcing the restoration of Jerusalem and the return of Jews from exile to the City of David, meant to inspire confidence that God would restore Jerusalem and her people.

The "beautiful feet" describe messengers running across distant hills toward Jerusalem, bringing the announcement of the exiles' certain return to their homeland. The beauty isn't about the messenger's physical appearance. Instead, the passage quickly shifts focus from the "feet" to the message's content: "peace … good news … salvation … 'Your God reigns!'" The word "beautiful" carries the idea of "full bloom" or "mature development," emphasizing the rapid, vigorous approach of the messenger bringing joyful news.

Ancient Jewish interpretations varied. The [Pesikta of Rav Kahana includes extended interpretations](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/isaiah/52-7.htm) of the messenger bringing "good news," with some identifying this as Isaiah himself, others as the returned exiles of Israel in the era of redemption, and some interpreting it of the future Messiah. The Targum Jonathan and Rabbi Moses Haddarschan also applied it messianically to the age of redemption.

The good news proclaimed is "Your God reigns!" This powerful declaration affirms God's sovereignty and faithfulness in restoring His exiled people to Jerusalem, fulfilling His covenant promises despite judgment.

### Christian Interpretation

Christians believe this prophecy found renewed application in the gospel message. The Apostle Paul quotes this passage in Romans 10:15, applying it to the mission of evangelism: "And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, 'How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!'" (ESV). Paul notably shifts the focus from a single "him" to the plural "those," broadening the application to all who carry the gospel message.

Christians interpret the "good news" as the message of peace with God through Jesus Christ, extending beyond Israel's physical restoration to spiritual redemption available to all nations.

## Conclusion

Isaiah 52:7 holds distinct but related meanings in Jewish and Christian traditions. The [Jewish interpretation](#jewish-interpretation) grounds the verse in the historical context of Israel's return from Babylonian exile, celebrating the messenger who announces God's faithfulness in restoring His people. In contrast, the [Christian interpretation](#christian-interpretation) sees this prophecy fulfilled and expanded in the gospel, where the "beautiful feet" belong to all who proclaim spiritual salvation through Jesus Christ. Both views highlight a central theme of divine redemption and the joy of receiving good news.
