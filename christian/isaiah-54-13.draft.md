# Taught by God

The prophet Isaiah foretold a future era of divine teaching, sparking varied interpretations across different faiths. What does it mean to be "taught by God," and how has this prophecy been understood?

## Prophecy

Isaiah 54 contains a promise of restoration and blessing for Israel, including a time when God’s people would receive direct instruction from Him.

> "All your children shall be taught by the LORD, and great shall be the peace of your children." — Isaiah 54:13 (ESV)

## Interpretations

This verse has been interpreted in different ways, particularly regarding who "the children" are and how they are "taught by the LORD."

### Christian View

Christians see this prophecy fulfilled in Jesus Christ. In the Gospel of John, Jesus directly quotes this passage to explain why people were drawn to His message.

> It is written in the Prophets, "**And they will all be taught by God.**" Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me... — John 6:45 (ESV)

The crowds also recognized that He taught "as one who had authority, and not as their scribes" (Matthew 7:29). From this perspective, Jesus is the ultimate teacher sent from God, providing direct revelation to humanity.

### Jewish View

In traditional Jewish thought, this verse is often understood as a promise related to the study of the Torah. The [Talmud](https://www.sefaria.org/Berakhot.64a?lang=bi), a central text of Rabbinic Judaism, interprets "your children" (banayich) as "your builders" (bonayich), suggesting that those who study the Torah become builders of peace in the world.

This view emphasizes that diligent study of God's laws and teachings is the pathway to the peace and prosperity promised in the prophecy.

## Conclusion

The prophecy of being "taught by God" is understood in at least two significant ways:

- **Christian Interpretation**: Jesus is the fulfillment, teaching with divine authority as described in [John 6:45](#christian-view).
- **Jewish Interpretation**: The study of the Torah is the means by which God teaches His people, as discussed in the [Talmud](#jewish-view).

Both traditions see this verse as a promise of divine guidance and the peace that results from it.
