# Taught by God

## Prophecy

Isaiah prophesied a time when God's people would be taught directly by the Lord.

> "All your children shall be taught by the LORD, and great shall be the peace of your children." — Isaiah 54:13 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian View

Jesus applied this prophecy to himself and his ministry:

> It is written in the Prophets, "**And they will all be taught by God.**" Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me... — John 6:45 (ESV)

The crowds also recognized that he taught "as one who had authority, and not as their scribes" (Matthew 7:29).

## Conclusion

**Christian fulfillment**

Jesus claimed to be the fulfillment of this promise, bringing direct revelation and teaching from God to the people.
