# The Sure Mercies of David

## Prophecy

Isaiah promised an everlasting covenant anchored in the faithful love promised to David.

> "Incline your ear, and come to me; hear, that your soul may live; and I will make with you an everlasting covenant, my steadfast, sure love for David." — Isaiah 55:3 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian View

The Apostle Paul explicitly interpreted this verse as a prophecy of the **resurrection of Jesus**. In his sermon at Antioch Pisidia, he argued that by raising Jesus from the dead, God fulfilled the promise to give the "holy and sure blessings of David" to his people.

> "And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead... he has spoken in this way, 'I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'" — Acts 13:34 (ESV)

Since the Davidic covenant involved an eternal throne, and death ends a reign, only a resurrected, eternal King could fully secure the "sure mercies" promised to David.

## Conclusion

**Christian fulfillment**

New Testament theology directly links this covenant promise to the resurrection of Christ, establishing it as the mechanism for the "everlasting covenant."
