# The Visit of the Magi

## Prophecy

In a vision of Zion's future glory, Isaiah described nations bringing specific gifts to the Lord.

> "A multitude of camels shall cover you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah; all those from Sheba shall come. They shall bring **gold and frankincense**, and shall bring good news, the praises of the LORD." — Isaiah 60:6 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian View

Matthew 2:11 records that wise men (Magi) from the East fell down and worshiped the child Jesus, offering him gifts of **gold, frankincense, and myrrh**. This is seen as a literal enactment of the nations (Gentiles) bringing these specific treasures to the King of the Jews.

While Isaiah mentions "gold and frankincense," the Magi added myrrh (associated with death/burial), but the specific pairing of the first two items is a direct link to the prophecy.

## Conclusion

**Christian fulfillment**

The arrival of foreign dignitaries bearing the specific commodities predicted by Isaiah to honor the Christ child is a striking historical detail recorded in the Gospel.
