# The Call of the Gentiles

## Prophecy

Isaiah prophesied that God would reveal Himself to a people who were not previously seeking Him or called by His name.

> "I was ready to be sought by those who did not ask for me; I was ready to be found by those who did not seek me. I said, 'Here I am, here I am,' to a nation that was not called by my name." — Isaiah 65:1 (ESV)

## Interpretations

### Jewish Interpretation

Jewish scholars understand [Isaiah 65:1 as referring to Israel itself](https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/isaiah-65/), not the Gentiles. The context of Isaiah 65 addresses Israel's rebellion and spiritual apostasy. The phrase "a nation that was not called by my name" describes Israel's degraded spiritual state—they had become like the heathen nations, abandoned calling on God's name, and instead pursued idolatry.

The traditional Jewish interpretation sees both verses 1-2 speaking to the same people (Israel) with descriptions of indifference and hardness. [The meaning is that Israel had sunk to the level of the heathen](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/isaiah/65-1.htm), becoming "a nation that has not called on my name" due to their idolatry and rebellion.

The immediately following verse (65:2) makes this clear: "I spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, following their own devices." This describes God's patient appeals to wayward Israel despite their persistent rebellion. The context throughout Isaiah 65-66 addresses Israel's sins: idolatry (65:3-4, 7, 11), self-righteousness (65:5), and disobedience (65:11-12).

The natural reading in context suggests God speaks to rebellious Israel in verse 1, with verse 2 elaborating on their obstinate rejection of Him.

### Christian Interpretation

Christians believe this prophecy was reapplied by the Apostle Paul to the Gentile mission. Paul explicitly cites this verse in Romans 10:20 to explain the phenomenon of Gentiles responding to the gospel while many Jews rejected it:

> Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, "I have been found by those who did not seek me; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me." — Romans 10:20 (ESV)

Paul interprets verse 1 as referring to the Gentiles, while applying verse 2 to Israel. Christians see the "nation that was not called by my name" as the Gentile nations who historically did not worship the God of Israel but responded in faith to the Christian message.

## Conclusion

**Competing interpretations**

**The Jewish interpretation** addresses Isaiah 65's context of Israel's rebellion. Both verses 1-2 refer to the same rebellious people—Israel—who had abandoned God so thoroughly that they became "a nation not called by my name," acting like idolatrous pagans. The chapter continues describing Israel's specific sins (idolatry, self-righteousness, disobedience), with God patiently appealing to His rebellious covenant people. This reading maintains textual coherence with the surrounding context.

**The Christian interpretation** requires separating verses 1 and 2 to refer to different groups: verse 1 to Gentiles, verse 2 to Israel. Paul's application in Romans 10:20 reinterprets Isaiah's rebuke of Israel's apostasy as a prophecy about Gentiles finding God. This reading sees Isaiah speaking beyond his immediate context about rebellious Israel to prophetically describe first-century Gentile inclusion, though this creates tension with the chapter's unified focus on Israel's sins and God's response to His covenant people.
