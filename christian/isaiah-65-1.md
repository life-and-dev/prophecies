# Isaiah 65:1 (A nation not called God)

A verse in the book of Isaiah sparks a centuries-old debate. Does it describe a rebellious Israel that had forsaken its God, or does it predict a future invitation to nations who had never known Him? This question has led to sharply contrasting interpretations, each with significant theological implications. This article explores the prophetic text, its historical context, and the different ways it has been understood.

## Prophecy

Isaiah prophesied that God would reveal Himself to a people who were not previously seeking Him or called by His name.

> "I was ready to be sought by those who did not ask for Me; I was ready to be found by those who did not seek Me. I said, 'Here I am, here I am,' to a nation that was not called by My name." — Isaiah 65:1 (ESV)

## Interpretations

### Jewish Interpretation

Jewish scholars understand [Isaiah 65:1 as referring to Israel itself](https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/isaiah-65/), not the Gentiles. The context of Isaiah 65 addresses Israel's rebellion and spiritual apostasy. The phrase "a nation that was not called by my name" describes Israel's degraded spiritual state—they had become like the heathen nations, abandoned calling on God's name, and instead pursued idolatry.

The traditional Jewish interpretation sees both verses 1-2 speaking to the same people (Israel) with descriptions of indifference and hardness. [The meaning is that Israel had sunk to the level of the heathen](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/isaiah/65-1.htm), becoming "a nation that has not called on my name" due to their idolatry and rebellion.

The immediately following verse (65:2) makes this clear: "I spread out my hands all the day to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, following their own devices." This describes God's patient appeals to wayward Israel despite their persistent rebellion. The context throughout Isaiah 65-66 addresses Israel's sins: idolatry (65:3-4, 7, 11), self-righteousness (65:5), and disobedience (65:11-12).

The natural reading in context suggests God speaks to rebellious Israel in verse 1, with verse 2 elaborating on their obstinate rejection of Him.

### Christian Interpretation

Christians believe this prophecy was reapplied by the Apostle Paul to the Gentile mission. Paul explicitly cites this verse in Romans 10:20 to explain the phenomenon of Gentiles responding to the gospel while many Jews rejected it:

> Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, "I have been found by those who did not seek me; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me." — Romans 10:20 (ESV)

Paul interprets verse 1 as referring to the Gentiles, while applying verse 2 to Israel. Christians see the "nation that was not called by my name" as the Gentile nations who historically did not worship the God of Israel but responded in faith to the Christian message.

## Conclusion

The prophecy in [Isaiah 65:1](#prophecy) presents a pivotal point of interpretation in both Jewish and Christian theology.

The [Jewish interpretation](#jewish-interpretation) views the verse as an address to a rebellious Israel that had strayed from God, becoming like a nation that did not know His name. This reading is supported by the immediate context of the chapter, which focuses on Israel's sins.

In contrast, the [Christian interpretation](#christian-interpretation), articulated by the Apostle Paul, sees the verse as a prophecy of the inclusion of the Gentiles into God's covenant. This view understands the "nation that was not called by my name" as the non-Jewish peoples who would come to faith.

Both views offer a coherent, though different, understanding of this significant passage.
