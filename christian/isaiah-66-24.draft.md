# The Unquenchable Fire

## Prophecy

Isaiah concluded his book with a sobering image of judgment involving undying worms and unquenchable fire for those who rebel against God.

> "...for their worm shall not die, their fire shall not be quenched, and they shall be an abhorrence to all flesh." — Isaiah 66:24 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian View

Jesus repeatedly cited this specific imagery to describe the reality of **Gehenna** (Hell), confirming Isaiah's description as the authoritative picture of final judgment.

> "And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell, 'where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.'" — Mark 9:47-48 (ESV)

## Conclusion

**Christian fulfillment**

Jesus affirmed the literal and spiritual reality of Isaiah's final warning, using the prophet's exact words to warn of eternal separation from God.
