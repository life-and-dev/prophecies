# The Virgin Birth

## Prophecy

> "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the **virgin** shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name **Immanuel**." — Isaiah 7:14 (ESV)

## Textual Variants

The Hebrew word used for "virgin" is **עַלְמָה** (*almah*), which can mean either "young woman" or "virgin." However, the [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint) (the ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament) translated it as **παρθένος** (*parthenos*), which specifically means "virgin."

This translation choice in the Septuagint is significant because the Gospel of Matthew quotes the Greek version when applying the prophecy to Jesus.

This isn't strictly a textual variant (the Hebrew is the same), but it represents an early interpretive translation that profoundly influenced Christian reading of the text.

## Fulfillment

### Jews

Jewish scholars interpret this passage in its immediate historical context during the [Syro-Ephraimite War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syro-Ephraimite_War) (c. 735 BCE), when King Pekah of Israel and King Rezin of Damascus threatened to depose King Ahaz of Judah. The "sign" was given to assure Ahaz that God would protect Jerusalem from this alliance.

#### The Definite Article

The Hebrew text uses "**ha-almah**" (הָעַלְמָה) — "**the** young woman," not "a young woman." This definite article indicates Isaiah was pointing to a **specific, identifiable woman** that both he and Ahaz could see or knew about at that moment. The use of "the" suggests the woman was present or immediately known to both parties, making the sign concrete and verifiable.

#### The Verb Tense

The Hebrew verb "**harah**" (הָרָה) is in the present/perfect tense, meaning "**is pregnant**" or "has conceived," not future tense. This indicates the young woman was **already pregnant** when Isaiah spoke, making the timeline immediate and measurable rather than distant. ([Source: Biblical Hermeneutics Stack Exchange](https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/13164/does-isaiah-714-indicate-that-the-young-woman-is-already-pregnant))

#### Identity: Isaiah's Wife

Jewish scholars identify "the young woman" as **Isaiah's wife**, referred to as "the prophetess" in Isaiah 8:3:

> "Then I approached the prophetess, and she conceived and bore a son. And the LORD said to me, 'Call his name Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz.'" — Isaiah 8:3 (ESV)

This child's birth is followed by the same timeline formula: "Before the boy knows how to cry 'My father' or 'My mother,' the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria will be carried away" (Isaiah 8:4). This parallel strongly suggests Isaiah 7:14 and 8:3-4 refer to the same pregnancy and child. ([Source: Outreach Judaism](https://outreachjudaism.org/dual-prophecy-virgin-birth/))

#### The Sign's Mechanism

The significance of the sign is not the **method** of conception (virginity), but the **timeline** it establishes. Isaiah was saying: "**This specific woman** (my wife), who is already pregnant, will soon give birth. Before **that child** reaches age 2-3 (when children distinguish right from wrong and recognize parents), your enemies will be destroyed." The name "Immanuel" ("God is with us") signified God's protective presence during the crisis, not necessarily the child's literal name.

The sign's verses continue: "For before the boy knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be deserted" (Isaiah 7:16). This created a **verifiable, time-bound prediction**: watch this specific child grow, and within 2-3 years, the threat will be eliminated. ([Source: Jews for Judaism](https://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/isaiah-714-a-virgin-birth/))

#### Why It Matters to Ahaz

Because "the young woman" was present, identifiable (Isaiah's pregnant wife), and the pregnancy already underway, King Ahaz could:
1. See the specific woman Isaiah referenced
2. Track the birth of that specific child
3. Measure the 2-3 year countdown to his enemies' defeat
4. Verify the prophecy's fulfillment in his own lifetime

A prophecy about a virgin birth 700 years in the future would have provided no comfort or verification to a king facing immediate military invasion. ([Source: What Jews Believe](https://whatjewsbelieve.org/isaiah-714/))

### Christian

Christians believe this prophecy was ultimately fulfilled in the birth of Jesus Christ. The Apostle Matthew explicitly cites this verse:

> "All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: 'Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel' (which means, God with us)." — Matthew 1:22-23 (ESV)

Christians argue that while there may have been a partial fulfillment in Ahaz's time, the specific language of "virgin" (as preserved in the Septuagint) and the name "Immanuel" point to what they believe was a miraculous event—the virgin birth of Jesus, whom Christian theology identifies as God incarnate (the Incarnation).

## Conclusion

**Competing interpretations**

The Jewish interpretation presents a coherent, verifiable historical fulfillment: Isaiah pointed to his own pregnant wife, giving King Ahaz a specific, measurable timeline (2-3 years) for God's deliverance from the Syro-Ephraimite threat. The prophecy was fulfilled when those two kingdoms were destroyed before Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz reached early childhood. This reading addresses the immediate context and Ahaz's need for reassurance during a military crisis.

The Christian interpretation relies on the Septuagint's translation of *almah* as *parthenos* ("virgin"), arguing that while there may have been an immediate historical fulfillment, the prophecy's ultimate meaning points to the miraculous virgin birth of Jesus. Matthew quotes the Greek version when applying this prophecy to Christ, viewing Jesus as the complete fulfillment of the Immanuel sign—God literally dwelling with humanity in the Incarnation.

The core disagreement centers on whether Isaiah 7:14 was:
1. **Only** an immediate historical prophecy (Jewish view) about Isaiah's wife and the 735 BCE crisis, or
2. **Both** an immediate sign to Ahaz **and** a future messianic prophecy pointing to Jesus (Christian view of "dual fulfillment")

This debate cannot be resolved by Hebrew grammar alone, as the text's immediate context strongly supports the historical reading, while the Septuagint's translation choice and New Testament application support the messianic interpretation.
