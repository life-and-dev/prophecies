# Messenger of the Covenant

The book of Malachi, the last prophetic voice in the Old Testament, closes with a dramatic promise: a messenger will appear to prepare the way for the Lord's sudden arrival at His temple. This prophecy has been a focal point of messianic expectation for centuries, sparking intense debate and diverse interpretations. Who is this mysterious messenger? And who is the "messenger of the covenant" that follows? This article explores the answers to these questions.

Malachi, the last prophet of the Old Testament, prophesied about a messenger who would prepare the way for the Lord's coming:

> "Behold, I send my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me. And the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to his temple; and the messenger of the covenant in whom you delight, behold, he is coming, says the LORD of hosts. But who can endure the day of his coming, and who can stand when he appears? For he is like a refiner's fire and like fullers' soap. He will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and he will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and they will bring offerings in righteousness to the LORD. Then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the LORD as in the days of old and as in former years." — Malachi 3:1-4 (ESV)

This prophecy contains two distinct figures:

1. **The messenger who prepares the way**. A forerunner announcing the Messiah's arrival.
2. **The Lord/messenger of the covenant**. The Messiah himself who would suddenly appear in the temple.

## Interpretations

### Christian View

Jesus identified John the Baptist as the messenger who prepared His way:

> As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. **This is he of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'** Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist." — Matthew 11:7-11 (ESV)

Mark's gospel explicitly applies this prophecy to John the Baptist:

> The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. **As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, "Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way, the voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight,'"** John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. — Mark 1:1-4 (ESV)

Luke records similar testimony:

> When the messengers of John had gone, he began to speak to the crowds concerning John: "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who are dressed in splendid clothing and live in luxury are in kings' courts. What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. **This is he of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.'**" — Luke 7:24-27 (ESV)

The New Testament presents clear evidence:

- **Jesus' identification** (Matthew 11:10; Luke 7:27): Jesus explicitly identifies John the Baptist as the messenger
- **Gospel writers' application** (Mark 1:2-4): Direct citation as fulfilled prophecy
- **Temple appearance** (Luke 2:22-38; John 2:13-17): Jesus came to the temple
- **Messenger of new covenant** (Hebrews 8:6, 9:15, 12:24): Jesus mediates the new covenant
- **Purifying work** (Matthew 21:12-13): Jesus cleansed the temple

### Jewish View

Malachi 3:1-4 is recognized in Jewish tradition as describing events before the Messiah's coming, though interpretations differ significantly from Christian views.

**Jewish objections include:**

1. **Elijah as forerunner**: Jews expect the prophet Elijah to return before the Messiah (based on Malachi 4:5-6, which immediately follows this passage). [This is based on the idea that Elijah did not die but was taken up to heaven directly (2 Kings 2:9–12)](https://jewsforjesus.org/messianic-prophecies/the-messiah-would-be-preceded-by-elijah-the-prophet). They reject that John the Baptist fulfilled this because: (a) John explicitly denied being Elijah (John 1:21), (b) Elijah never died, so his return should be the same person, not someone "in the spirit of Elijah."

2. **Temple purification unfulfilled**: Malachi describes the Lord coming to His temple and purifying the Levites so they can offer righteous sacrifices. Jesus didn't restore the Levitical priesthood or temple sacrifices — instead, these ended permanently in 70 AD after His death.

3. **Refiner's fire**: The prophecy speaks of purification "like a refiner's fire" producing righteous offerings to God. Jews argue this depicts a violent, obvious purification that didn't occur.

4. **New covenant problematic**: Christians interpret this as the "new covenant," but Jews argue God's covenant with Israel is eternal and irrevocable (Jeremiah 31:35-37), not replaceable.

### Christian Rebuttal

Christians respond to Jewish objections by arguing for spiritual fulfillment and the new covenant prophesied in the Old Testament.

**John as Elijah:**

The angel prophesied John would come "in the spirit and power of Elijah" (Luke 1:17) — functioning in Elijah's role without being the literal person. Jesus explicitly said, "If you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come" (Matthew 11:14).

When asked "Are you Elijah?" John said no (John 1:21) because he wasn't literally Elijah reincarnated. But he fulfilled Elijah's prophetic role as forerunner.

Some Christians believe Malachi 4:5-6 has dual fulfillment — John fulfilled it at Jesus' first coming; literal Elijah may return before the second coming (Revelation 11:3-6 describes two witnesses with Elijah-like powers).

**Spiritual Temple Purification:**

Jesus purified God's people through His blood (Hebrews 9:13-14), enabling believers to offer spiritual sacrifices pleasing to God (1 Peter 2:5; Romans 12:1; Hebrews 13:15-16).

Under the new covenant, all believers are priests (1 Peter 2:9; Revelation 1:6), offering "spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ" (1 Peter 2:5). This fulfills the purification of Levites at a higher level — all God's people become a kingdom of priests.

Jesus did cleanse the physical temple (Matthew 21:12-13), demonstrating His authority over the temple system. His ultimate work was establishing a new temple — the church, His body (John 2:19-21; 1 Corinthians 3:16).

**Refiner's Fire as Suffering:**

The "refiner's fire" is fulfilled through the suffering and trials believers endure, which purify faith (1 Peter 1:6-7: "tested by fire"). Jesus Himself endured the ultimate refining fire of crucifixion.

The "who can endure the day of his coming?" finds partial fulfillment in Jesus' first coming (judgment on religious leaders, Matthew 23) and complete fulfillment at His second coming (Revelation 19-20).

**New Covenant Prophesied:**

The new covenant isn't a Christian invention — Jeremiah 31:31-34 explicitly prophesies it within the Old Testament. God Himself says, "I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel... not like the covenant that I made with their fathers."

The new covenant fulfills God's ultimate purposes for Israel and brings the covenant blessings to all nations (Gentiles grafted in, Romans 11:17-24). The old covenant pointed forward to the new (Hebrews 8:5-13, 10:1).

## Conclusion

The prophecy in Malachi 3:1-4 has led to significantly different interpretations, particularly between Christian and Jewish traditions.

- The [Christian view](#christian-view) identifies John the Baptist as the messenger who prepared the way for Jesus, who is seen as the "messenger of the covenant." This interpretation is based on the words of Jesus Himself and the writings of the Gospel authors.
- The [Jewish view](#jewish-view), on the other hand, raises several objections to this interpretation. These objections are based on the belief that Elijah must return in person, that the temple purification was not fulfilled, and that the covenant with Israel is eternal and cannot be replaced.
- The [Christian rebuttal](#christian-rebuttal) to these objections argues for a spiritual fulfillment of the prophecy, with John the Baptist coming "in the spirit and power of Elijah" and Jesus purifying a spiritual temple.

Ultimately, whether one sees the prophecy as fulfilled in Jesus and John the Baptist depends on whether one accepts a literal or spiritual fulfillment of the text.
