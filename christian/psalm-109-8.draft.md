# May Another Take His Office

## The Prophecy

> O God of my praise! Do not be silent! For wicked and deceitful mouths are opened against me, speaking against me with lying tongues. They encircle me with words of hate, and attack me without cause. In return for my love they accuse me, but I give myself to prayer. So they reward me evil for good, and hatred for my love. Appoint a wicked man against him; let an accuser stand at his right hand. When he is tried, let him come forth guilty; let his prayer be counted as sin! **May his days be few; may another take his office!** May his children be fatherless and his wife a widow! May his children wander about and beg, seeking food far from the ruins they inhabit! May the creditor seize all that he has; may strangers plunder the fruits of his toil! Let there be none to extend kindness to him, nor any to pity his fatherless children!... Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered before the LORD, and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out! For he did not remember to show kindness, but pursued the poor and needy and the brokenhearted, to put them to death. He loved to curse; let curses come upon him! He did not delight in blessing; may it be far from him! — Psalm 109:1-17 (ESV, selected verses)

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

Peter quoted this psalm when the disciples chose a replacement for Judas:

> "For it is written in the Book of Psalms, 'May his camp become desolate, and let there be no one to dwell in it'; and **'Let another take his office.'** So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us... must become with us a witness to his resurrection." — Acts 1:20-22 (ESV)

### Christian

Christians interpret this passage as messianic prophecy, arguing that:

- The psalm prophesied Judas's betrayal and fate
- The phrase "another take his office" specifically predicted apostolic succession after Judas's death
- The divine judgments pronounced in the psalm fell upon Judas for his betrayal

The psalm is understood as prophesying Judas's betrayal of Jesus and his subsequent replacement among the twelve apostles.

However, several contextual factors challenge this interpretation:

1. **David's Personal Imprecatory Prayer**: The psalm's superscription identifies it as "A Psalm of David." The content describes David's prayer against his historical enemies—people who "speak against me with lying tongues" (verse 2), who "reward me evil for good" (verse 5), and who attack him "without cause" (verse 3). This addresses David's actual enemies during his lifetime, not future events.

2. **The Entire Psalm Is a Curse Prayer**: David requests God to bring severe judgments on his enemy:
   - Make his accuser's children fatherless and his wife a widow (verse 9)
   - Make his children wander and beg (verse 10)
   - Seize all his possessions (verse 11)
   - Remember the sins of his parents (verse 14)
   - Let curses come upon him (verses 17-18)

   These harsh imprecations represent David's cry for divine justice against his persecutors, reflecting ancient Near Eastern concepts of judgment rather than messianic prophecy.

3. **Jesus Never Prayed Curses**: Throughout His ministry, Jesus consistently taught and practiced forgiveness:
   - "Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you" (Matthew 5:44)
   - "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" while being crucified (Luke 23:34)
   - Rebuked disciples who wanted to call down fire on a Samaritan village (Luke 9:54-55)

   Jesus' entire approach contradicts the vengeful spirit of Psalm 109. He never requested that His betrayer's children become fatherless or that his wife become a widow, nor did He pronounce such curses on Judas or anyone else.

4. **Peter Applied a General Principle**: Peter faced a practical problem—Judas had died, leaving a vacancy among the Twelve. Peter found Scriptures dealing with a wicked person's office becoming vacant and another taking that position. This represents applying a general biblical principle to address a current situation, not claiming David prophesied Judas specifically 1,000 years in advance.

5. **Generic Term for Position**: The Hebrew word *pekudah* (translated "office") simply means "position," "oversight," or "responsibility." It does not specifically mean "apostleship." In Psalm 109's original context, it likely referred to some civic or military position held by David's enemy.

6. **The Description Doesn't Fit Judas**: Verse 16 describes the wicked man as one who "pursued the poor and needy and the brokenhearted, to put them to death." This indicates:
   - Active persecution of multiple vulnerable people
   - A pattern of systematic violence
   - Intentional murder

   While Judas betrayed Jesus, he does not fit this description of systematically pursuing and murdering the poor and needy.

7. **Contradicts Jesus' Teaching on Vengeance**: The entire tone of Psalm 109 seeks vengeance:
   - "Let curses come upon him!" (verse 17)
   - "Clothe him with his curses like a coat" (verses 18-19)
   - "May this be the reward of my accusers from the LORD" (verse 20)

   Jesus explicitly taught against such vengeance: "Do not resist the one who is evil" (Matthew 5:39). Paul later wrote, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord" (Romans 12:19). The psalm's spirit fundamentally contradicts Jesus' teaching and example.

### Critical

Critical scholars view Psalm 109 as an imprecatory psalm expressing David's intense plea for divine justice against his personal enemies who attacked him with false accusations. The harsh curses reflect ancient Near Eastern justice concepts and the psalmist's cry for vindication. Peter's application in Acts represents a hermeneutical principle—using scriptural wisdom to address contemporary situations—rather than claiming the psalm originally functioned as prophecy about Judas. The application occurs after the events, selecting a verse that resonates with the circumstances rather than demonstrating predictive prophecy.

## Conclusion

**Decontextualized fulfillment.** Psalm 109 is David's intense imprecatory prayer asking God to judge his enemies—people who attacked him with lies and repaid his love with hatred. The psalm's harsh curses reflect David's cry for vindication against his historical persecutors, employing concepts of justice common in ancient Near Eastern culture. Peter applied one phrase ("may another take his office") to address the practical need to replace Judas among the Twelve. This represents hermeneutical application—using Scripture's wisdom for current situations—not a claim that David prophesied Judas's betrayal. The psalm's vengeful spirit contradicts Jesus' consistent teaching on loving enemies and forgiving persecutors. No Old Testament author identifies this as messianic prophecy, and the detailed description of the wicked man's character and actions does not correspond to Judas's historical role. The passage must be extracted from its original context as David's personal prayer to be applied as prophecy.
