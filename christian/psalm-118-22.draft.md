Psalm 118:22, "The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone," is a powerful verse with deep significance in both Judaism and Christianity. While it is celebrated in Jewish tradition as a hymn of national deliverance, it is also cited in the New Testament as a prophecy of Jesus Christ. This article explores the historical context of the psalm and the different ways it has been interpreted, offering insight into its enduring importance.

# The Stone the Builders Rejected

## Christian Interpretation

Psalm 118 is a thanksgiving hymn celebrating God's deliverance:

> Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever! Let Israel say, "His steadfast love endures forever." Let the house of Aaron say, "His steadfast love endures forever." Let those who fear the LORD say, "His steadfast love endures forever."
>
> Out of my distress I called on the LORD; the LORD answered me and set me free. The LORD is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me? The LORD is on my side as my helper; I shall look in triumph on those who hate me...
>
> I shall not die, but I shall live, and recount the deeds of the LORD. The LORD has disciplined me severely, but he has not given me over to death. Open to me the gates of righteousness, that I may enter through them and give thanks to the LORD...
>
> **The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This is the LORD's doing; it is marvelous in our eyes.** This is the day that the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.
>
> Save us, we pray, O LORD! O LORD, we pray, give us success! **Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD!** We bless you from the house of the LORD. The LORD is God, and he has made his light to shine upon us. — Psalm 118:1-27 (selected verses, ESV)

### Apostles

Jesus and the apostles quoted this psalm multiple times:

> Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: **'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?** Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits." — Matthew 21:42-43 (ESV)

> And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved." Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John... they recognized that they had been with Jesus. But seeing the man who was healed standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition. But when they had commanded them to leave the council, they conferred with one another, saying, "What shall we do with these men?... But so that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name." — Acts 4:11-17 (ESV)

Christians interpret this as:
- **Jesus as the rejected stone** - Rejected by Jewish leaders
- **Became the cornerstone** - Essential foundation of God's building (the church)
- **The LORD's doing** - God vindicated Jesus through resurrection
- **Blessed is he who comes** - Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem

The psalm is understood as prophesying the Messiah's rejection and vindication.

## Historical Context

### Why This Is Misunderstood

1. **The entire psalm celebrates YHWH's goodness**: The refrain throughout is:
   - "Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good" (v. 1)
   - "His steadfast love endures forever" (vv. 1-4)
   - "The LORD answered me and set me free" (v. 5)
   - "The LORD is on my side" (vv. 6-7)

   The psalm is about thanking God for deliverance, not primarily about the Messiah.

2. **"The stone" and "the LORD" are distinct**: Verse 22-23 says:
   - "The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone"
   - "**This is the LORD's doing**; it is marvelous in our eyes"

   The psalm distinguishes between:
   - The rejected stone (someone vindicated)
   - The LORD (God who did the vindicating)

   God elevated the stone; the stone isn't identified as God or the Messiah in the psalm itself.

3. **The stone imagery could apply to various situations**: The metaphor of a rejected stone becoming essential can apply to:
   - Israel as a nation (rejected by powerful empires but chosen by God)
   - David (rejected by Saul but made king)
   - Any righteous person vindicated after being wrongly rejected
   - The returning exiles (despised but restored by God)

   It's a powerful image of reversal and vindication, but not necessarily a specific prophecy about one person.

4. **The psalm isn't exclusively messianic**: Unlike Psalm 110 or Psalm 2 which have clear royal/messianic elements, Psalm 118:
   - Doesn't mention a king or anointed one
   - Uses corporate language ("Let Israel say," "Let the house of Aaron say")
   - Focuses on thanksgiving for deliverance
   - Contains one metaphorical image that can be applied broadly

5. **Jesus applied it but didn't claim it was originally about him alone**: When Jesus quoted the stone verse, he used it as an illustration of what was happening—the religious leaders were rejecting him, but God would vindicate him. This is using Scripture's imagery for his situation, which is different from claiming the psalm was written exclusively as a prophecy about him.

6. **"Blessed is he who comes" was a standard greeting**: The phrase "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD" (v. 26) was a standard liturgical greeting for pilgrims coming to the temple. It wasn't a specific messianic prophecy but a general blessing. People shouted it at Jesus' triumphal entry because he was coming to Jerusalem, using the traditional greeting.

7. **The psalm is a liturgical processional hymn**: The structure suggests this was used in temple worship:
   - Call to thanksgiving (vv. 1-4)
   - Testimony of deliverance (vv. 5-21)
   - Processional entry into the temple (vv. 19-27)
   - Closing thanksgiving (vv. 28-29)

   The "stone" verse is one image within a larger hymn about God's faithfulness.

## Interpretations

### Jewish Interpretation

In Jewish tradition, Psalm 118 is generally understood as a hymn of thanksgiving for national deliverance, and the "rejected stone" is interpreted in several non-messianic ways ([source](https://thekollel.com/the-stone-that-the-builders-rejected-became-a-cornerstone-psalms-11822/)):

- **Israel as the Stone**: The most common interpretation is that the "stone" represents the nation of Israel. Rejected and oppressed by the powerful empires of the ancient world (the "builders"), Israel was ultimately chosen by God to be the "cornerstone" of His covenant people.
- **David as the Stone**: Some rabbinic sources connect the stone to King David. Before becoming king, David was rejected by his own family and by King Saul, yet he was chosen by God to establish the Davidic dynasty.
- **The Righteous Individual**: The metaphor can also be applied to any righteous person who endures suffering and rejection but is ultimately vindicated by God.

The psalm is recited during major Jewish holidays, including Passover, Sukkot, and Hanukkah, underscoring its themes of redemption and divine praise. The focus remains on God's steadfast love and His role as the savior of Israel, rather than a prophecy of a future individual Messiah.
