# The Stone the Builders Rejected

## The Prophecy

Psalm 118 is a thanksgiving hymn celebrating God's deliverance:

> Oh give thanks to the LORD, for he is good; for his steadfast love endures forever! Let Israel say, "His steadfast love endures forever." Let the house of Aaron say, "His steadfast love endures forever." Let those who fear the LORD say, "His steadfast love endures forever."
>
> Out of my distress I called on the LORD; the LORD answered me and set me free. The LORD is on my side; I will not fear. What can man do to me? The LORD is on my side as my helper; I shall look in triumph on those who hate me...
>
> I shall not die, but I shall live, and recount the deeds of the LORD. The LORD has disciplined me severely, but he has not given me over to death. Open to me the gates of righteousness, that I may enter through them and give thanks to the LORD...
>
> **The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This is the LORD's doing; it is marvelous in our eyes.** This is the day that the LORD has made; let us rejoice and be glad in it.
>
> Save us, we pray, O LORD! O LORD, we pray, give us success! **Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD!** We bless you from the house of the LORD. The LORD is God, and he has made his light to shine upon us. — Psalm 118:1-27 (selected verses, ESV)

### Apostles

Jesus and the apostles quoted this psalm multiple times:

> Jesus said to them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures: **'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?** Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits." — Matthew 21:42-43 (ESV)

> And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved." Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John... they recognized that they had been with Jesus. But seeing the man who was healed standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition. But when they had commanded them to leave the council, they conferred with one another, saying, "What shall we do with these men?... But so that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name." — Acts 4:11-17 (ESV)

Christians interpret this as:
- **Jesus as the rejected stone** - Rejected by Jewish leaders
- **Became the cornerstone** - Essential foundation of God's building (the church)
- **The LORD's doing** - God vindicated Jesus through resurrection
- **Blessed is he who comes** - Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem

The psalm is understood as prophesying the Messiah's rejection and vindication.

## Original Context

### Why This Is Misunderstood

1. **The entire psalm celebrates YHWH's goodness**: The refrain throughout is:
   - "Give thanks to the LORD, for he is good" (v. 1)
   - "His steadfast love endures forever" (vv. 1-4)
   - "The LORD answered me and set me free" (v. 5)
   - "The LORD is on my side" (vv. 6-7)

   The psalm is about thanking God for deliverance, not primarily about the Messiah.

2. **"The stone" and "the LORD" are distinct**: Verse 22-23 says:
   - "The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone"
   - "**This is the LORD's doing**; it is marvelous in our eyes"

   The psalm distinguishes between:
   - The rejected stone (someone vindicated)
   - The LORD (God who did the vindicating)

   God elevated the stone; the stone isn't identified as God or the Messiah in the psalm itself.

3. **The stone imagery could apply to various situations**: The metaphor of a rejected stone becoming essential can apply to:
   - Israel as a nation (rejected by powerful empires but chosen by God)
   - David (rejected by Saul but made king)
   - Any righteous person vindicated after being wrongly rejected
   - The returning exiles (despised but restored by God)

   It's a powerful image of reversal and vindication, but not necessarily a specific prophecy about one person.

4. **The psalm isn't exclusively messianic**: Unlike Psalm 110 or Psalm 2 which have clear royal/messianic elements, Psalm 118:
   - Doesn't mention a king or anointed one
   - Uses corporate language ("Let Israel say," "Let the house of Aaron say")
   - Focuses on thanksgiving for deliverance
   - Contains one metaphorical image that can be applied broadly

5. **Jesus applied it but didn't claim it was originally about him alone**: When Jesus quoted the stone verse, he used it as an illustration of what was happening—the religious leaders were rejecting him, but God would vindicate him. This is using Scripture's imagery for his situation, which is different from claiming the psalm was written exclusively as a prophecy about him.

6. **"Blessed is he who comes" was a standard greeting**: The phrase "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the LORD" (v. 26) was a standard liturgical greeting for pilgrims coming to the temple. It wasn't a specific messianic prophecy but a general blessing. People shouted it at Jesus' triumphal entry because he was coming to Jerusalem, using the traditional greeting.

7. **The psalm is a liturgical processional hymn**: The structure suggests this was used in temple worship:
   - Call to thanksgiving (vv. 1-4)
   - Testimony of deliverance (vv. 5-21)
   - Processional entry into the temple (vv. 19-27)
   - Closing thanksgiving (vv. 28-29)

   The "stone" verse is one image within a larger hymn about God's faithfulness.

## Conclusion

**Misunderstood context.** Psalm 118 is a thanksgiving hymn celebrating God's steadfast love and deliverance. The stone imagery (vv. 22-23) is a powerful metaphor for reversal—something rejected becoming essential through God's action. This image can apply to various situations where God vindicates the rejected.

Jesus applied this imagery to himself when religious leaders rejected him, and it proved apt—they rejected him, but God vindicated him through resurrection. The apostles continued using this image for Jesus. However, the original psalm:
- Doesn't identify the stone as the Messiah
- Is primarily about thanking YHWH for deliverance
- Uses imagery that can apply to multiple situations of vindication
- Functions as a liturgical hymn, not a messianic prophecy

The Christian interpretation depends on:
- Treating one metaphorical image as a specific prophecy about Jesus
- Isolating verses 22-23 from the broader thanksgiving context
- Assuming Jesus' application means the psalm was originally written about him
- Reading "Blessed is he who comes" as messianic rather than a standard temple greeting
- Overlooking that the psalm focuses on praising YHWH for deliverance, not predicting the Messiah
