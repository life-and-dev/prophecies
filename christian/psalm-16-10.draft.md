# You Will Not Abandon My Soul to Sheol

## The Prophecy

> For you will **not abandon my soul to Sheol**, or **let your holy one see corruption**. You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore. — Psalm 16:10-11 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

The apostle Peter preached at Pentecost, explicitly applying this psalm to Jesus' resurrection:

> Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, he foresaw and spoke **of the resurrection of the Christ**, that **he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption**. This **Jesus God raised up**, and of that we all are witnesses. — Acts 2:29-32 (ESV)

Peter argues that:
- David died and his tomb remained (therefore couldn't be speaking of himself)
- David spoke prophetically of the Messiah's resurrection
- Jesus' body did not "see corruption" (decay)
- Jesus was raised from the dead
- The apostles all witnessed the resurrection

Paul also cited this psalm:

> Therefore he says also in another psalm, **"You will not let your Holy One see corruption."** For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and **saw corruption**, but **he whom God raised up did not see corruption**. — Acts 13:35-37 (ESV)

### Jews

**Not accepted as messianic.** Traditional rabbinic sources consistently interpret Psalm 16 as David speaking about himself rather than the Messiah. Jewish scholars object based on contextual and theological grounds:

**David Speaking About Himself**: The entire psalm is first-person ("my soul," "your holy one" referring to David himself). David expresses confidence that God will protect him from death during his lifetime. The psalm functions as a prayer for God's protection, not messianic prophecy.

**Sheol Means the Grave**: In Hebrew thought, Sheol is the grave or realm of the dead—everyone goes there. "Not abandon to Sheol" means "preserve from death" or "rescue from dying," not "resurrect after death." This is standard biblical language for divine protection from premature death. David prays that God will not let him die.

**"See Corruption" Means "Experience Death"**: The phrase means "don't let me die" or "protect me from decay while alive." This is a prayer for protection from premature death and bodily decay, not prediction of resurrection. The Hebrew word "shachath" (corruption/pit) refers to the grave or destruction that comes with death. David asks God to preserve his life so his body won't decay in a grave.

**David's Confidence Fulfilled**: God did protect David from many dangers throughout his life. The psalm was fulfilled in David's own experience when God repeatedly delivered him from enemies (Saul, Absalom, etc.). No resurrection is required—God simply preserved David's life.

**No Resurrection Expectation in David's Time**: Jewish theology during David's time (~1000 BC) didn't have developed resurrection doctrine. That concept came later (Daniel 12:2, written ~165 BC). David wasn't prophesying about resurrection because that theological framework didn't yet exist. He simply asked God to protect him from death.

### Christian

Christians believe Jesus fulfilled this prophecy, arguing that:

**Peter's Explicit Argument**: Peter directly addresses the Jewish interpretation. He acknowledges David died and his tomb remained with them "to this day" (Acts 2:29). Therefore, David could not have been speaking about himself. Peter argues David spoke prophetically as one who knew God promised to raise up the Messiah from his descendants (Acts 2:30-31). This represents authoritative apostolic interpretation.

**"See Corruption" Requires Resurrection**: The phrase "not let your holy one see corruption" implies the person dies (enters the grave) but doesn't remain long enough for bodily decay. If this merely meant "preserve from death," the phrase would be "not die" rather than "not see corruption." The mention of corruption/decay implies death occurs but resurrection happens before decomposition. Jesus was buried but rose on the third day before His body decayed.

**Paul's Contrast**: Paul explicitly contrasts David (who "saw corruption" after death) with Jesus (whom "God raised up" and "did not see corruption") in Acts 13:36-37. This apostolic interpretation clarifies that David experienced death and decay, while Jesus experienced resurrection before corruption.

**"Your Holy One" Distinguished**: While David calls himself a "holy one" (Hebrew: hasid, meaning faithful/godly one), Peter's application to Jesus as "the Holy One" takes on greater significance. Jesus is the uniquely Holy One of God (Mark 1:24; Luke 4:34; Acts 3:14), making this title ultimately messianic.

**Timing Matches**: Jesus rose on the third day (Matthew 28:1-6), before significant bodily decomposition would occur. Ancient understanding recognized that decay began after three days, making resurrection before corruption a specific, measurable claim.

**Apostolic Witness**: Peter appeals to collective apostolic testimony: "of that we all are witnesses" (Acts 2:32). This represents not individual interpretation but the unified testimony of eyewitnesses to the resurrection.

## Conclusion

**Debatable fulfillment.** Peter at Pentecost (Acts 2:29-32) and Paul in Antioch (Acts 13:35-37) explicitly applied Psalm 16:10 to Jesus' resurrection, providing authoritative apostolic interpretation. Peter argues that David died and his tomb remained, therefore David spoke prophetically about the Messiah, not himself. Jesus was buried but rose on the third day before bodily decomposition, literally fulfilling "not let your holy one see corruption." The apostles collectively witnessed this resurrection (Acts 2:32). However, Jewish scholars interpret Psalm 16 as David's personal prayer for protection from death during his lifetime, not messianic prophecy. The entire psalm is first-person, expressing confidence that God will preserve David from premature death. "Not abandon to Sheol" means rescue from dying, not resurrect after death. "See corruption" means experience death and decay, which David prays to avoid. God did protect David throughout his life, fulfilling the psalm without requiring resurrection. Additionally, resurrection theology didn't exist in David's time (~1000 BC), developing later (Daniel 12:2). Whether the psalm represents David's personal prayer fulfilled in his lifetime or prophetic description of Messiah's resurrection depends on interpretive framework. The phrase "see corruption" could mean either "don't let me die" (Jewish view) or "raise me before decay" (Christian view). Apostolic interpretation applies it to Jesus, but the original context suggests David's personal confidence in divine protection.
