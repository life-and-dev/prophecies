# I Will Give Thanks Among the Nations

## The Prophecy

> The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock, and exalted be the God of my salvation—the God who gave me vengeance and **subdued peoples under me**, who delivered me from my enemies; yes, you exalted me above those who rose against me; you delivered me from the man of violence. **For this I will praise you, O LORD, among the nations, and sing to your name.** Great salvation he brings to his king, and shows **steadfast love to his anointed, to David and his offspring forever**. — Psalm 18:46-50 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

Paul quotes Psalm 18:49 in Romans as part of his argument that Christ came for both Jews and Gentiles:

> For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God's truthfulness, in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs, and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, **"Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name."** — Romans 15:8-9 (ESV)

### Christian

Christians interpret this psalm as prophetic of Jesus, arguing that:

- "His anointed" points to the Messiah (Christ means "anointed one")
- "Among the nations/Gentiles" foreshadows Jesus' gospel going to all nations
- "David and his offspring forever" refers to Jesus as David's ultimate descendant
- "Subdued peoples" describes Jesus' spiritual victory over sin, death, and Satan
- Paul's quotation in Romans demonstrates apostolic recognition of messianic application

The psalm is understood as describing the Messiah's ultimate victory and worldwide praise among all nations.

However, several contextual factors challenge this interpretation:

1. **Superscription Explicitly Identifies David's Personal Testimony**: The heading reads "To the choirmaster. A Psalm of **David, the servant of the LORD, who addressed the words of this song to the LORD on the day when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul**." This is David's personal thanksgiving song for specific historical deliverance, not a prophecy about future events.

2. **Entire Psalm Describes David's Actual Experiences**: The psalm recounts David's specific life experiences:
   - He was pursued by enemies (Saul and others who sought his life)
   - He cried out to God for deliverance in his distress
   - God rescued him from his enemies
   - He defeated nations and expanded Israel's territory
   - He gave thanks for these historical victories

   The entire context is autobiographical, describing what God did for David personally.

3. **David Historically Ruled Over Gentiles**: David conquered and ruled over numerous gentile nations, as documented in 2 Samuel 8: the Philistines, Moabites, Ammonites, Edomites, Arameans, and others became subject to him. The psalm's reference to "subdued peoples under me" and praising God "among the nations" describes David's actual historical military victories and territorial expansion.

4. **Praising Among Gentiles Fits David's Historical Context**: After conquering gentile nations and bringing them under Israel's dominion, David would naturally give thanks to God among those peoples he now ruled. This is historical description of David's reign, not prophecy about a distant future Messiah.

5. **"His Anointed" Refers to David Himself**: Throughout the Old Testament, "anointed" (*mashiach*/messiah) refers to Israel's kings, especially David. Saul called David "the LORD's anointed" (1 Samuel 24:6,10; 26:9,11,16,23). The term was a royal title for the reigning king, not exclusively a reference to a future Messiah. In context, "shows steadfast love to his anointed, to **David**" directly identifies David himself as the anointed one being referenced.

6. **Past Tense Describes Completed Events**: The psalm is written in past tense, describing completed deliverance: "he delivered," "you exalted," "you delivered me," "the God who gave me vengeance." There is no future-oriented prophetic language suggesting this points to someone beyond David.

7. **Shared Characteristics Don't Equal Prophecy**: The fact that both David and Jesus were anointed kings, ruled over gentiles (David physically, Jesus spiritually), gave thanks to God, and had enemies does not make every statement about David prophetic of Jesus. If this interpretive logic held, nearly every psalm David wrote would be classified as "messianic prophecy." Typological connections (Jesus as greater David) differ from original prophetic intent.

8. **Paul's Use is Typological Application**: When Paul quotes Psalm 18:49 in Romans 15:9, he employs a pattern of scriptural citations (from Deuteronomy, Psalms, and Isaiah) to demonstrate that God's plan always included the Gentiles. Paul uses David's words typologically—applying David's experience to the greater reality in Christ—rather than claiming David originally prophesied Jesus. This is theological application rather than asserting original prophetic intent.

### Critical

Critical scholars view Psalm 18 as David's personal thanksgiving song for God's deliverance from Saul and his other enemies, celebrating his historical military victories over gentile nations. The superscription explicitly identifies it as David's composition about his own life experiences. The psalm describes completed historical events in past tense. "His anointed" refers to David himself, who was literally anointed as Israel's king. Paul later applies David's words typologically in Romans 15:9, seeing Christ as the greater David through whom God's mercy extends to the Gentiles, but this represents theological application rather than the psalm's original prophetic intent.

## Conclusion

**Decontextualized fulfillment.** Psalm 18 is David's personal thanksgiving song for God's deliverance from Saul and his enemies, celebrating his historical military victories over gentile nations he conquered (documented in 2 Samuel 8). The superscription explicitly identifies it as David's composition "on the day when the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul." The entire psalm describes David's actual experiences in past tense. "His anointed" refers to David himself, who was called "the LORD's anointed" throughout 1 Samuel. David literally ruled over gentiles and praised God "among the nations" he conquered. While Paul quotes verse 49 in Romans 15:9 to demonstrate God's plan for Gentiles, this represents typological application (Jesus as greater David) rather than claiming David originally prophesied Jesus. Shared characteristics between David and Jesus (both anointed kings, both ruling over gentiles, both praising God) do not make David's personal testimony prophetic. No Old Testament author identifies this as messianic prophecy. The passage must be extracted from its explicit historical context as David's personal thanksgiving to apply it as prophecy about Jesus.
