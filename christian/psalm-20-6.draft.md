# The LORD Saves His Anointed

## The Prophecy

> May the LORD answer you in the day of trouble! May the name of the God of Jacob protect you! May he send you help from the sanctuary and give you support from Zion! May he remember all your offerings and regard with favor your burnt sacrifices! May he grant you your heart's desire and fulfill all your plans! May we shout for joy over your salvation, and in the name of our God set up our banners! **Now I know that the LORD saves his anointed; he will answer him from his holy heaven with the saving might of his right hand.** Some trust in chariots and some in horses, but we trust in the name of the LORD our God. **They collapse and fall, but we rise and stand upright.** O LORD, save the king! May he answer us when we call. — Psalm 20:1-9 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian

Christians interpret this psalm as referring to Jesus, arguing that:

- "His anointed" refers to the Messiah (Christ means "anointed one")
- "The LORD saves" points to God's ultimate deliverance through Jesus
- "Answer him from his holy heaven" foreshadows Jesus' resurrection and ascension
- "We rise and stand upright" describes resurrection victory over death
- "Save the king" refers to Jesus as the messianic King

The psalm is understood as prophesying God's deliverance of the Messiah and victory over enemies.

However, several contextual factors challenge this interpretation:

1. **Psalm for Israel's Reigning King**: The superscription identifies this as "A Psalm of David." This is a liturgical prayer for the king, most likely composed for use before military campaigns. It was used for Israel's reigning monarchs, not exclusively as messianic prophecy.

2. **"Anointed" Was Standard Royal Title**: David himself was anointed as king by Samuel (1 Samuel 16:13). Throughout the Old Testament, "the LORD's anointed" referred to Israel's reigning king. Saul was called "the LORD's anointed" (1 Samuel 24:6,10; 26:9,11,16,23). When this psalm says "his anointed," it refers to David or whoever was the current king of Israel, not exclusively a future Messiah.

3. **Psalm Requests Protection from Danger**: The prayer asks God to:
   - Answer in the day of trouble
   - Send help and support from the sanctuary and Zion
   - Remember offerings and sacrifices
   - Grant heart's desire and fulfill plans
   - Save from enemies

   These are requests for military victory and protection from death in battle. The psalm asks God to prevent harm, not to raise someone from death.

4. **God Did Not Protect Jesus This Way**: Unlike the psalm's promises, Jesus' experience contradicts these requests:
   - Jesus was not protected in His "day of trouble" (Gethsemane, trial, crucifixion)
   - God did not send help to prevent His death
   - Jesus' prayer "let this cup pass from me" (Matthew 26:39) was not granted in the way requested
   - Jesus was captured, tried, and executed—not saved from His enemies during His earthly ministry
   - No help came from the sanctuary or Zion to rescue Him

5. **Psalm Promises Victory Where Enemies "Collapse and Fall"**: The contrast is stark: "They collapse and fall, but we rise and stand upright" (verse 8). This describes military victory where the king's army defeats their foes on the battlefield—enemies fall down while the king's forces remain standing. It does not describe resurrection after death but immediate battlefield victory where enemies are defeated while the righteous remain alive and victorious.

6. **Corporate Worship Before Battle**: Phrases like "may we shout for joy" (verse 5) and "we trust in the name of the LORD our God" (verse 7) show this is a communal prayer, likely recited corporately before the king went to war. It is liturgical worship, not prophecy. The community prays together for their king's military success.

7. **Present Tense Statement of Confidence**: "Now I know that the LORD saves his anointed" (verse 6) is a present-tense statement of confidence in God's current protection of the current king, not a future-oriented prophecy about a distant Messiah. It expresses trust that God will protect the king in the upcoming battle.

8. **Final Plea**: The psalm concludes with "O LORD, save the king! May he answer us when we call" (verse 9). This is a direct plea for God to save (rescue, deliver from danger) the king. Jesus was not saved/rescued from crucifixion—He died on the cross despite prayers for deliverance.

### Critical

Critical scholars view Psalm 20 as a royal liturgy used before military campaigns, where the community prayed for their king's victory and protection in battle. The "anointed" refers to Israel's reigning king who was literally anointed with oil as part of coronation ceremony. The psalm expresses confidence that God will protect the king from enemies and grant military victory. The requests for help, support, and salvation refer to battlefield protection and victory, not resurrection. The psalm functioned liturgically in Israel's worship, not as messianic prophecy. Its promises of protection and deliverance directly contradict Jesus' historical experience of being captured and executed.

## Conclusion

**Decontextualized fulfillment.** Psalm 20 is a liturgical prayer for Israel's king going into battle, asking God for military victory and protection from enemies. The superscription identifies it as "A Psalm of David," likely composed for use before military campaigns. "His anointed" refers to Israel's reigning king—David or his successors—who were literally anointed as part of coronation ceremony. The term "anointed" was standard royal title for Israel's kings, not exclusively messianic. The psalm requests that God answer in the day of trouble, send help, grant victory, and save the king from death at enemies' hands. The contrast "They collapse and fall, but we rise and stand upright" describes immediate battlefield victory, not resurrection. The psalm's promises directly contradict Jesus' experience—God did not send help to prevent His death, did not grant His prayer to avoid crucifixion, and did not save Him from His enemies during His earthly ministry. Jesus was captured, tried, and executed rather than protected from danger as the psalm requests. No Old Testament author identifies this as messianic prophecy. The passage must be extracted from its context as a royal military prayer to apply it to Jesus.
