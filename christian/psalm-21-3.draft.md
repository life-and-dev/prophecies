# Crown of Fine Gold Upon His Head

Psalm 21 is traditionally known as a royal psalm, a song of thanksgiving for a king's victory and blessings. It speaks of a golden crown, long life, and glory bestowed by God. While historically applied to Israelite kings, some Christians interpret this psalm as a prophecy about the Messiah, Jesus. This article explores the historical context of Psalm 21 and examines the arguments for and against its application to Jesus.

## The Prophecy

> O LORD, in your strength the king rejoices, and in your salvation how greatly he exults! You have given him his heart's desire and have not withheld the request of his lips. For you meet him with rich blessings; **you set a crown of fine gold upon his head. He asked life of you; you gave it to him, length of days forever and ever.** His glory is great through your salvation; splendor and majesty you bestow on him. For you make him most blessed forever; you make him glad with the joy of your presence. For the king trusts in the LORD, and through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be moved. Your hand will find out all your enemies; your right hand will find out those who hate you. You will make them as a blazing oven when you appear. The LORD will swallow them up in his wrath, and fire will consume them. — Psalm 21:1-9 (ESV)

## Interpretations

### Christian View

Christians often interpret this psalm as a prophecy referring to Jesus, arguing that:

- The "crown... upon his head" represents Jesus' kingship and ultimate coronation.
- The "length of days forever and ever" refers to Jesus' eternal life through his resurrection.
- The "glory... through your salvation" describes Jesus' exaltation after the crucifixion.
- Being "most blessed forever" points to Jesus' eternal reign.
- The consumption of enemies by fire is seen as a reference to Jesus' final judgment.

In this view, the psalm is understood as a prophecy of the Messiah's coronation, eternal life, and ultimate victory.

### Scholarly Criticisms

However, several contextual and historical factors present challenges to this interpretation:

1. **Genre of a Royal Thanksgiving Psalm**: The superscription identifies this as "A Psalm of David." It is categorized as a royal thanksgiving psalm, likely composed to celebrate a military victory or the coronation of an Israelite king. The psalm's use of the past tense—"you have given," "you meet him," "you set a crown"—suggests a celebration of a current king's triumph rather than a prophecy about a future Messiah.

2. **Crown of Gold Versus Crown of Thorns**: The psalm specifically mentions "a crown of **fine gold**" (verse 3). This is in stark contrast to the crown Jesus received:
   > And twisting together a **crown of thorns**, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, "Hail, King of the Jews!" — Matthew 27:29 (ESV)

   The crown Jesus wore was an instrument of mockery and pain, the opposite of the golden crown of honor described in the psalm.

3. **A Request for Life**: The psalm states, "He asked life of you; you gave it to him, length of days forever and ever" (verse 4). This describes a person who requested to be saved from death. In contrast, Jesus:
   - Willingly laid down His life: "I lay down my life that I may take it up again. No one takes it from me, but I lay it down of my own accord" (John 10:17-18).
   - Did not ask to be spared from death, but prayed, "not my will, but yours be done" (Luke 22:42).
   - Understood his mission to require his death as an atonement, not to avoid it.

   The psalm portrays someone asking to be preserved from death, whereas Jesus willingly embraced it.

4. **Destruction of Enemies by Fire**: Verses 8-12 describe the king's enemies being consumed by fire: "You will make them as a blazing oven when you appear. The LORD will swallow them up in his wrath, and fire will consume them." This imagery is difficult to reconcile with Jesus' teachings to "love your enemies" (Matthew 5:44) and his prayer for his executioners: "Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do" (Luke 23:34). While Christian theology includes a final judgment, this does not align with Jesus' actions during his earthly ministry.

5. **The King "Shall Not Be Moved"**: Verse 7 states, "through the steadfast love of the Most High he shall not be moved." This suggests a state of continual security and protection. Yet, Jesus was:
   - Arrested and bound.
   - Mocked and beaten.
   - Crucified and killed.
   - Appeared to be overcome by his enemies, although Christians believe this was a temporary state.

   The psalm describes a person who remains secure and unmoved, which contrasts with Jesus' experience of betrayal, arrest, and execution.

6. **Liturgical Use for Multiple Kings**: Psalm 21 is one of several "royal psalms" (such as Psalms 2, 18, 20, 45, 72, 110) used in Israel's worship to celebrate and pray for their kings. These psalms were used liturgically for various kings throughout Israel's history and were not written exclusively about one future individual.

7. **Hyperbolic Royal Language**: Phrases like "length of days forever and ever" are characteristic of the hyperbolic language of ancient Near Eastern court poetry. This style of writing often wished the king long life and prosperity and is found in other royal psalms and ancient texts celebrating kings. It does not necessarily imply literal eternal life.

## Conclusion

Psalm 21 is identified as a [royal thanksgiving psalm](#scholarly-criticisms) celebrating an Israelite king. The [Christian interpretation](#christian-view) views it as a messianic prophecy fulfilled by Jesus. However, [scholarly criticism](#scholarly-criticisms) points to several contradictions between the psalm's text and the life of Jesus. These include the crown of gold versus the crown of thorns, the request for life versus a willing sacrifice, the promise of not being moved versus Jesus' arrest and execution, and the destruction of enemies versus Jesus' teachings of love and forgiveness. Ultimately, the historical and literary context of the psalm suggests it was intended for an Israelite king, and applying it to Jesus requires removing it from that original context.
