# My God, My God, Why Have You Forsaken Me?

## The Prophecy

> **My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?** Why are you so far from saving me, from the words of my groaning? O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer, and by night, but I find no rest. — Psalm 22:1-2 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

> And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" that is, **"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"** — Matthew 27:46 (ESV)

> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" which means, **"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"** — Mark 15:34 (ESV)

### Christian

Christians believe Jesus fulfilled this prophecy by quoting Psalm 22:1 exactly from the cross, arguing that:

**Exact Quotation**: Jesus quoted Psalm 22:1 word-for-word from the cross, documented by multiple Gospel writers (Matthew and Mark). The Aramaic/Hebrew words are preserved in the Greek text, showing the precise quotation.

**Prophetic Context**: By quoting the opening line, Jesus drew attention to the entire Psalm 22, which contains remarkable details about crucifixion (piercing hands and feet, bones out of joint, garments divided, mocking) that David could not have witnessed in his own time, suggesting prophetic intent.

**Spiritual Forsakenness**: Jesus experienced the profound spiritual separation from God that David described, bearing the weight of humanity's sin (2 Corinthians 5:21). This cry expresses the genuine anguish of that moment.

**Documented Witness**: The cry is documented by eyewitnesses in multiple independent Gospel accounts, establishing its historical occurrence.

However, whether this represents prophetic fulfillment or Jesus using familiar scriptural language depends on one's interpretive framework:

**Jewish Perspective**: Jews view Psalm 22 as David's personal lament during persecution, not messianic prophecy. The psalm's superscription identifies it as "A Psalm of David," and the content describes David's own suffering and deliverance. When someone quotes Scripture in a moment of trial, it does not necessarily mean that Scripture prophesied their specific situation. Jesus may have been using David's existing prayer to express His own anguish, drawing on familiar liturgical language without claiming the psalm originally prophesied Him. Many faithful Jews throughout history have quoted this same psalm during suffering without implying it prophesied them.

**Alternate Interpretation**: Some scholars note that in Jewish practice, citing the opening line of a psalm could reference the entire psalm. Psalm 22, while beginning with forsakenness, ends with praise and deliverance ("he has done it," verse 31). Jesus may have been pointing to ultimate victory despite present suffering, using a well-known prayer that moves from anguish to triumph.

## Conclusion

**Debatable fulfillment.** Jesus quoted Psalm 22:1 exactly from the cross—a direct verbal correspondence documented by multiple eyewitnesses in the Gospels. The question hinges on interpretation: Did David write this prophetically about the Messiah's future suffering, or was Jesus using familiar scriptural language from David's personal lament to express His own anguish? People throughout history have quoted Scripture during trials without claiming those passages originally prophesied their specific situations. The superscription identifies Psalm 22 as "A Psalm of David," and the content describes David's own persecution and deliverance. No Old Testament author explicitly identifies this as messianic prophecy. Whether Jesus' quotation represents prophetic fulfillment or the use of existing liturgical prayer language depends on one's broader interpretive framework about the psalm's original intent. The exact quotation is undeniable; the prophetic nature is debated.
