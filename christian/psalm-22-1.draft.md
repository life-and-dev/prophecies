# My God, My God, Why Have You Forsaken Me?

The cry, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" from Psalm 22:1 is one of the most poignant and debated verses in the Bible. Famously uttered by Jesus on the cross, these words have become a cornerstone of Christian theology, viewed as a direct fulfillment of Old Testament prophecy. However, their interpretation is far from monolithic. Within Jewish tradition, they are seen as the personal lament of King David, a powerful expression of faith amidst suffering. This article explores the historical and theological landscape of this verse, examining the arguments for and against its prophetic nature and delving into the rich tapestry of meaning it holds for both Christians and Jews.

## Psalm 22

> **My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?** Why are you so far from saving me, from the words of my groaning? O my God, I cry by day, but you do not answer, and by night, but I find no rest. — Psalm 22:1-2 (ESV)

## Interpretations

### Apostles

> And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" that is, **"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"** — Matthew 27:46 (ESV)

> And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" which means, **"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"** — Mark 15:34 (ESV)

### Christian

Christians believe Jesus fulfilled this prophecy by quoting Psalm 22:1 exactly from the cross, arguing that:

**Exact Quotation**: Jesus quoted Psalm 22:1 word-for-word from the cross, documented by multiple Gospel writers (Matthew and Mark). The Aramaic/Hebrew words are preserved in the Greek text, showing the precise quotation.

**Prophetic Context**: By quoting the opening line, Jesus drew attention to the entire Psalm 22, which contains remarkable details about crucifixion (piercing hands and feet, bones out of joint, garments divided, mocking) that David could not have witnessed in his own time, suggesting prophetic intent.

**Spiritual Forsakenness**: Jesus experienced the profound spiritual separation from God that David described, bearing the weight of humanity's sin (2 Corinthians 5:21). This cry expresses the genuine anguish of that moment.

**Documented Witness**: The cry is documented by eyewitnesses in multiple independent Gospel accounts, establishing its historical occurrence.

However, whether this represents prophetic fulfillment or Jesus using familiar scriptural language depends on one's interpretive framework:

### Jewish Perspective

Jews view Psalm 22 as David's personal lament during persecution, not messianic prophecy. The psalm's superscription identifies it as "A Psalm of David," and the content describes David's own suffering and deliverance. When someone quotes Scripture in a moment of trial, it does not necessarily mean that Scripture prophesied their specific situation. Jesus may have been using David's existing prayer to express His own anguish, drawing on familiar liturgical language without claiming the psalm originally prophesied Him. Many faithful Jews throughout history have quoted this same psalm during suffering without implying it prophesied them. The translation of verse 16 is a key point of contention. While Christian Bibles often translate the Hebrew as "they have pierced my hands and feet," Jewish translations, based on the Masoretic Text, render it as "like a lion, they are at my hands and my feet." As the Jewish commentator Rashi explains, this imagery depicts enemies tearing at the sufferer's hands and feet, a metaphor for intense physical agony.

### Alternate Interpretation

Some scholars note that in Jewish practice, citing the opening line of a psalm could reference the entire psalm. Psalm 22, while beginning with forsakenness, ends with praise and deliverance ("he has done it," verse 31). Jesus may have been pointing to ultimate victory despite present suffering, using a well-known prayer that moves from anguish to triumph.

## Conclusion

The cry of "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?" is undeniably a pivotal moment in the crucifixion narrative, with [Jesus's exact quotation of Psalm 22:1](##interpretations) recorded in the Gospels. The central debate revolves around whether this was the [fulfillment of a messianic prophecy](##christian) or the use of a [personal lament written by King David](##jewish-perspective) to express profound suffering. While Christians point to the psalm's detailed descriptions of crucifixion-like suffering as evidence of its prophetic nature, Jewish scholarship maintains that it is a personal prayer, with key verses translated differently. Ultimately, the interpretation of this verse remains a matter of faith and theological perspective, with both sides presenting compelling arguments.
