# They Have Pierced My Hands and Feet

## The Prophecy

> For dogs encompass me; a company of evildoers encircles me; **they have pierced my hands and feet**—I can count all my bones—they stare and gloat over me. — Psalm 22:16-17 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

The New Testament records Jesus showing His crucifixion wounds:

> Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here, and see **my hands**; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe." — John 20:27 (ESV)

> See **my hands and my feet**, that it is I myself. Touch me, and see. For a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you see that I have. — Luke 24:39 (ESV)

Thomas specifically asked to see the nail marks:

> So the other disciples told him, "We have seen the Lord." But he said to them, "Unless I see in **his hands the mark of the nails**, and place my finger into the mark of the nails, and place my hand into his side, I will never believe." — John 20:25 (ESV)

### Jews

**Not accepted as messianic.** Jewish scholars reject this interpretation based on textual and contextual grounds:

**Textual Dispute**: The Hebrew Masoretic Text reads "ka'ari" (כָּאֲרִי) meaning "like a lion [at my hands and feet]," not "pierced." The word for "pierced" would be "karu" (כָּרוּ). The ESV rendering "they have pierced" follows the Septuagint Greek translation, not the original Hebrew text. Jews argue Christians rely on a Greek mistranslation rather than the authoritative Hebrew text.

**Grammatical Awkwardness**: Even Christian scholars acknowledge "like a lion my hands and feet" creates grammatical difficulty. The Hebrew text lacks a clear verb, making the phrase incomplete. This suggests possible textual corruption or scribal error rather than intentional prophecy.

**Lament Psalm, Not Prophecy**: Psalm 22 is a lament psalm expressing David's personal suffering. The superscription attributes it "To the choirmaster: according to The Doe of the Dawn. A Psalm of David." This indicates liturgical use for expressing distress, not messianic prophecy. David describes his own enemies surrounding him like dogs and lions.

**Crucifixion Anachronism**: Crucifixion was invented by Persians and later adopted by Romans—centuries after David. If this were prophecy, it would describe an execution method unknown in David's time. More likely, the passage describes being mauled or attacked by enemies metaphorically described as lions and dogs.

### Christian

Christians believe Jesus fulfilled this prophecy, arguing that:

**Ancient Translations Support "Pierced"**: The Septuagint (Greek Old Testament translated by Jewish scholars around 250 BC, before Christianity existed) rendered the phrase as "pierced" (ὤρυξαν). This demonstrates that ancient Jewish translators understood the text this way, not just later Christian interpreters.

**Dead Sea Scrolls Evidence**: Some Dead Sea Scroll fragments of Psalm 22 support the "pierced" reading, providing manuscript evidence older than the Masoretic Text. While the evidence is fragmentary, it suggests textual variants existed in antiquity.

**Context Favors "Pierced"**: The surrounding context describes suffering inflicted by enemies: "they encircle me," "they stare and gloat over me," "they divide my garments." These actions describe what enemies do to the psalmist. "They have pierced my hands and feet" fits this pattern of enemy action, while "like a lion my hands and feet" is grammatically incomplete and contextually awkward.

**Prophetic Description of Crucifixion**: David wrote around 1000 BC, yet Psalm 22 remarkably describes crucifixion details:
- Hands and feet pierced (nail wounds)
- Bones not broken but visible ("I can count all my bones")
- Public mockery while suffering ("they stare and gloat")
- Garments divided (Psalm 22:18)

David couldn't have witnessed crucifixion, yet the description matches precisely.

**Jesus' Own Application**: Jesus quoted Psalm 22:1 from the cross ("My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"), indicating He understood this psalm as describing His suffering. The disciples later connected the pierced hands and feet to this prophecy.

## Conclusion

**Debatable fulfillment.** Jesus was crucified with nails through His hands and feet, documented in the New Testament where Thomas examined the nail marks (John 20:25-27) and Jesus showed His pierced hands and feet to disciples (Luke 24:39). The description in Psalm 22:16 remarkably matches crucifixion—an execution method invented centuries after David wrote this psalm. However, the Hebrew Masoretic Text reads "ka'ari" (like a lion) rather than "karu" (pierced). The ESV rendering "they have pierced" follows the Septuagint Greek translation (circa 250 BC) which read "pierced," and some Dead Sea Scroll fragments may support this reading. Jewish scholars argue Christians rely on Greek mistranslation rather than authoritative Hebrew text, and that Psalm 22 is a lament psalm expressing David's personal suffering from enemies, not messianic prophecy. The textual dispute between "like a lion" (Masoretic) and "pierced" (Septuagint, Dead Sea Scrolls) creates fundamental uncertainty. Whether this represents prophetic description of crucifixion or David's poetic description of being attacked by enemies depends on both textual criticism and interpretive framework.
