# They Divide My Garments, Cast Lots for My Clothing

Psalm 22:18, which reads, "They divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots," is one of the most debated verses in the Hebrew Bible. While it appears in a psalm attributed to King David describing his own suffering, it is also cited in the New Testament as a prophecy fulfilled during the crucifixion of Jesus. This article explores the historical context of the psalm, its interpretation within Judaism, and the Christian claim of its messianic fulfillment.

## The Prophecy

> All who see me mock me; they make mouths at me; they wag their heads; "He trusts in the LORD; let him deliver him; let him rescue him, for he delights in him!" ... I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax; it is melted within my breast; my strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to my jaws; you lay me in the dust of death. For dogs encompass me; a company of evildoers encircles me; they have pierced my hands and feet—I can count all my bones—they stare and gloat over me; **they divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots**. — Psalm 22:7-18 (ESV)

## Interpretations

### New Testament Accounts

> And when they had crucified him, **they divided his garments among them by casting lots**. — Matthew 27:35 (ESV)

John provides more specific detail:

> When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, **they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom**, so they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but **cast lots for it to see whose it shall be**." This was to fulfill the Scripture which says, **"They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots."** So the soldiers did these things. — John 19:23-24 (ESV)

### Christian Interpretation

The Christian interpretation holds that Roman soldiers unknowingly fulfilled Psalm 22:18 during the crucifixion of Jesus. Key arguments include:

**John's Explicit Citation**: The Gospel of John explicitly states that the soldiers' actions fulfilled the Scripture, directly citing Psalm 22:18 (John 19:24). This is presented as eyewitness testimony connecting the event to prophecy.

**Dual Action Fulfilled**: The prophecy contains two distinct actions—dividing garments and casting lots—both of which occurred. Soldiers divided Jesus' outer garments into four parts, one for each soldier, and then cast lots for his seamless tunic. The dual statement in the psalm aligns with the dual action at the crucifixion.

**Beyond Jesus' Control**: Jesus could not have orchestrated this event. The Roman soldiers were acting according to their standard procedures for the possessions of executed criminals, which Christians see as an independent fulfillment of a prophecy written approximately 1,000 years earlier.

**Specific Detail**: The detail about the seamless tunic explains why both actions were necessary. The outer garments were divided, but the valuable tunic required casting lots to determine ownership without damaging it.

### Jewish Interpretation

Jewish scholarship traditionally views Psalm 22 as a personal lament by King David during a time of intense persecution, not as a messianic prophecy. The arguments for this interpretation are as follows:

**David's Personal Experience**: The superscription of the psalm identifies it as "A Psalm of David." The text describes David's own suffering, his plea for deliverance, and his eventual praise for God's rescue. It is seen as a reflection of his own historical experiences, such as when he fled from King Saul or during Absalom's rebellion ([Psalm 22 - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psalm_22)).

**Common Practice**: The act of dividing the garments of defeated or executed individuals was a common practice in the ancient world. Victors and executioners regularly plundered the possessions of their victims. Therefore, this event was not unique and does not necessitate a prophetic explanation.

**Coincidental Match**: From a Jewish perspective, the fact that Roman soldiers divided Jesus' garments is a coincidence, as it was standard Roman practice. This does not, in itself, prove that Psalm 22 was intended as a messianic prophecy.

**No Messianic Markers**: The psalm does not contain explicit messianic markers. It is written in the first person, as David's personal prayer. The content focuses on his enemies, his physical suffering, and his plea for God's deliverance.

### Critical Scholarship

Critical scholars generally approach Psalm 22 as a lament psalm, consistent with the Jewish interpretation. They note the following:

*   **Genre and Context**: The psalm fits the genre of an individual lament, where a person expresses suffering and trusts in God for deliverance. The superscription attributes it to David, and the content is consistent with personal affliction.
*   **Common Ancient Practice**: Dividing the garments of the executed was a common practice in the ancient world, not a unique event.
*   **Gospel Interpretation**: The Gospel writers, particularly John, saw parallels between Jesus' crucifixion and Psalm 22. They interpreted Jesus' experience through the lens of David's lament, viewing it as a fulfillment of Scripture. Whether this reflects prophetic intent or the Gospel writers finding meaning in existing texts is a matter of interpretive framework.

## Conclusion

The interpretation of Psalm 22:18 is a key point of difference between Jewish and Christian theology. The [Christian interpretation](#christian-interpretation) views the verse as a direct prophecy of the crucifixion of Jesus, citing the fulfillment of the dual actions of dividing garments and casting lots by Roman soldiers. In contrast, the [Jewish interpretation](#jewish-interpretation) sees the psalm as a personal lament of King David, with the events described being common occurrences in the ancient world. [Critical scholarship](#critical-scholarship) also tends to view the psalm as a lament, with the New Testament writers interpreting the events of the crucifixion through the lens of existing scripture. Ultimately, whether one views the verse as a prophecy fulfilled or a coincidental alignment of events depends on one's theological framework.
