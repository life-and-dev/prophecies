# They Divide My Garments, Cast Lots for My Clothing

## The Prophecy

> All who see me mock me; they make mouths at me; they wag their heads; "He trusts in the LORD; let him deliver him; let him rescue him, for he delights in him!" ... I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint; my heart is like wax; it is melted within my breast; my strength is dried up like a potsherd, and my tongue sticks to my jaws; you lay me in the dust of death. For dogs encompass me; a company of evildoers encircles me; they have pierced my hands and feet—I can count all my bones—they stare and gloat over me; **they divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots**. — Psalm 22:7-18 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

> And when they had crucified him, **they divided his garments among them by casting lots**. — Matthew 27:35 (ESV)

John provides more specific detail:

> When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, **they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom**, so they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but **cast lots for it to see whose it shall be**." This was to fulfill the Scripture which says, **"They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots."** So the soldiers did these things. — John 19:23-24 (ESV)

### Christian

Christians believe Roman soldiers unknowingly fulfilled Psalm 22:18, arguing that:

**John's Explicit Citation**: John explicitly states this fulfilled Scripture, directly citing Psalm 22:18 (John 19:24). This represents eyewitness testimony connecting the event to prophecy.

**Dual Action Fulfilled**: The prophecy contains two distinct actions—dividing garments and casting lots—both of which occurred. Soldiers divided Jesus' outer garments into four parts (one for each soldier), then cast lots specifically for the seamless tunic to avoid tearing it. The dual statement in the psalm matches the dual action at the crucifixion.

**Beyond Jesus' Control**: This was not something Jesus could orchestrate. Roman soldiers spontaneously acted according to their standard practice with executed criminals' possessions, unknowingly fulfilling what David wrote approximately 1,000 years earlier.

**Specific Detail**: The detail about the seamless tunic explains why both actions occurred—garments were divided, but the valuable seamless tunic required casting lots to determine ownership without destroying it.

However, whether Psalm 22 originally prophesied the Messiah is disputed:

### Jews

Jewish scholars view Psalm 22 as David's personal lament during persecution, not messianic prophecy. The superscription identifies it as "A Psalm of David." The entire psalm describes David's own suffering and plea for deliverance from enemies.

**Common Practice**: Dividing garments of executed criminals was standard practice. Victors and executioners regularly plundered the possessions of the defeated or executed. This was not a unique or unusual occurrence requiring prophetic explanation.

**David's Own Experience**: David likely experienced his enemies dividing his possessions when he fled from Saul or during Absalom's rebellion. The psalm describes David's actual historical persecution, not a prophecy about events 1,000 years in the future.

**Coincidental Match**: That soldiers divided Jesus' garments does not prove Psalm 22 was originally messianic prophecy. It was standard Roman practice with executed criminals. The coincidental match does not establish prophetic intent.

**No Messianic Markers**: The psalm contains no explicit messianic markers. It is written in first person as David's personal prayer during suffering. The content describes David's enemies mocking him, his physical suffering, and his plea for God to deliver him.

### Critical

Critical scholars view Psalm 22 as David's lament psalm expressing his suffering and trust in God during persecution. The superscription attributes it to David, and the content describes personal affliction and enemies. Dividing garments of executed or defeated persons was common practice in the ancient world. The Gospel writers, particularly John, saw connections between Jesus' crucifixion and Psalm 22, interpreting Jesus' experience through the lens of David's lament. Whether this represents prophetic fulfillment or the Gospel writers finding meaningful parallels in existing Scripture depends on one's interpretive framework.

## Conclusion

**Debatable fulfillment.** Roman soldiers divided Jesus' garments among themselves and cast lots for His seamless tunic, with John explicitly citing Psalm 22:18 as fulfilled (John 19:23-24). The dual action (dividing garments and casting lots) matches the psalm's dual statement, and this was beyond Jesus' control—soldiers acting according to standard practice. However, whether Psalm 22:18 was originally messianic prophecy is disputed. The superscription identifies the psalm as "A Psalm of David," and the entire content describes David's personal suffering and plea for deliverance from enemies who mock him and cause him physical anguish. Dividing garments of executed criminals was standard practice in the ancient world—victors and executioners regularly plundered possessions of the defeated. David likely experienced similar treatment when fleeing from Saul or during Absalom's rebellion. Jewish scholars view this as David's historical lament, with the crucifixion detail representing coincidental match to common practice rather than prophetic fulfillment. No Old Testament author identifies Psalm 22 as messianic prophecy. The literal fulfillment is documented, but whether the psalm originally functioned as prophecy or David was describing his own experience (with Jesus' crucifixion later matching through common executioner practices) depends on one's interpretive framework.
