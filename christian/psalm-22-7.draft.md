# He Trusts in the LORD; Let Him Deliver Him

## The Prophecy

> All who see me **mock me**; they make mouths at me; they **wag their heads**; **"He trusts in the LORD; let him deliver him; let him rescue him, for he delights in him!"** — Psalm 22:7-8 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

> And **those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads** and saying, "You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross." So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, **mocked him**, saying, "He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. **He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him**. For he said, 'I am the Son of God.'" And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way. — Matthew 27:39-44 (ESV)

### Christian

Christians believe the mockers at Jesus' crucifixion unknowingly fulfilled Psalm 22:7-8, arguing that:

**Verbatim Quote**: The chief priests, scribes, and elders quoted Psalm 22:8 almost word-for-word: "He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him" closely matches "He trusts in the LORD; let him deliver him... for he delights in him." This represents precise verbal correspondence.

**Multiple Matching Details**: Not just the words but multiple specific details match:
- Mocking (Psalm 22:7 / Matthew 27:39-43)
- Wagging heads (Psalm 22:7 / Matthew 27:39)
- The specific taunt about trusting in God (Psalm 22:8 / Matthew 27:43)

**Beyond Jesus' Control**: This was not something Jesus could orchestrate or fabricate. His opponents spontaneously spoke these words. The religious leaders who opposed Jesus unknowingly quoted Scripture written approximately 1,000 years earlier, fulfilling the psalm without realizing it.

**Documented by Eyewitness**: Matthew, a disciple who witnessed these events (or recorded eyewitness testimony), documented the precise words spoken by the mockers, showing their correspondence to Psalm 22.

However, whether Psalm 22 originally prophesied the Messiah is disputed:

### Jews

Jewish scholars view Psalm 22 as David's personal lament during persecution, not messianic prophecy. The superscription identifies it as "A Psalm of David." The entire psalm describes David's own suffering, enemies mocking him, and his plea for God's deliverance from those who oppose him.

**David's Experience**: David himself experienced mockery from enemies who questioned why God would allow him to suffer. When David fled from Saul or during Absalom's rebellion, his enemies likely taunted him similarly, questioning God's favor toward him.

**Common Taunt**: The taunt "He trusts in God; let God deliver him" represents a common form of mockery directed at any righteous sufferer throughout history. When faithful people suffer, opponents often mock their faith by saying "Where is your God now?" or "If God loves you, let Him save you." This is not a unique prophetic detail but a universal pattern of how enemies mock the faithful.

**Coincidental Match**: That mockers at the crucifixion used similar language does not prove Psalm 22 was originally messianic prophecy. People throughout history have used similar taunts against the faithful. The Gospel writers, familiar with Psalms, may have emphasized this connection, but it does not establish original prophetic intent.

**No Messianic Markers**: The psalm contains no explicit messianic indicators. It is written in first person as David's personal prayer during suffering, with no references to a future Messiah, anointed king, or coming deliverer.

### Critical

Critical scholars view Psalm 22 as David's lament psalm expressing his suffering and trust in God during persecution. The mocking described represents common taunts directed at faithful sufferers—questioning why God allows the righteous to suffer if He truly loves them. The Gospel writers, deeply familiar with Scripture, recognized verbal parallels between Jesus' crucifixion and Psalm 22, particularly in the mockers' words. Whether this represents prophetic fulfillment or the Gospel writers drawing connections between Jesus' experience and David's ancient lament depends on one's interpretive framework regarding the psalm's original intent.

## Conclusion

**Debatable fulfillment.** The mockers at Jesus' crucifixion spoke words that closely match Psalm 22:8: "He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him." Multiple details correspond: mocking, wagging heads, and the specific taunt about trusting in God. This was beyond Jesus' control—His opponents spontaneously spoke these words. Matthew documented the precise correspondence. However, whether Psalm 22:7-8 was originally messianic prophecy is disputed. The superscription identifies it as "A Psalm of David," and the entire content describes David's personal suffering and enemies mocking him. The taunt "He trusts in God; let God deliver him" represents a common form of mockery directed at righteous sufferers throughout history, questioning God's protection of the faithful. David himself likely experienced similar mockery from enemies during his persecution. No Old Testament author identifies Psalm 22 as messianic prophecy. The verbal correspondence is striking, but whether this represents prophetic fulfillment or coincidental use of common mocking language (with Gospel writers recognizing the parallel to David's psalm) depends on one's interpretive framework about the psalm's original intent.
