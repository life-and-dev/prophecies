# Into Your Hand I Commit My Spirit

## The Prophecy

> In you, O LORD, do I take refuge; let me never be put to shame; in your righteousness deliver me! Incline your ear to me; rescue me speedily! Be a rock of refuge for me, a strong fortress to save me! **Into your hand I commit my spirit; you have redeemed me, O LORD, faithful God.** I hate those who pay regard to worthless idols, but I trust in the LORD. I will rejoice and be glad in your steadfast love, because you have seen my affliction; you have known the distress of my soul, and you have not delivered me into the hand of the enemy; you have set my feet in a broad place. Be gracious to me, O LORD, for I am in distress; my eye is wasted from grief; my soul and my body also... But I trust in you, O LORD; I say, "You are my God." My times are in your hand; rescue me from the hand of my enemies and from my persecutors! How abundant is your goodness, which you have stored up for those who fear you and worked for those who take refuge in you, in the sight of the children of mankind! In the cover of your presence you hide them from the plots of men; you store them in your shelter from the strife of tongues. **Blessed be the LORD, for he has wondrously shown his steadfast love to me when I was in a besieged city.** — Psalm 31:1-21 (ESV, selected verses)

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

Jesus quoted from this psalm while dying on the cross:

> Then Jesus, calling out with a loud voice, said, "**Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!**" And having said this he breathed his last. — Luke 23:46 (ESV)

### Christian

Christians interpret this as prophetic fulfillment, arguing that:

- Jesus consciously fulfilled David's words at His death
- The phrase demonstrates Jesus' ultimate trust in God the Father
- Jesus' willing surrender of His spirit to God fulfills the psalm
- The phrase "you have redeemed me" (verse 5b) points forward to Jesus' redemptive death

The psalm is understood as prophesying the Messiah's death in trusting submission to God.

However, several contextual factors challenge this interpretation:

1. **Jesus Quoted Only One Line**: Jesus used one phrase from the psalm ("into your hands I commit my spirit"), but quoting a single line does not make the entire psalm prophetic about Him. People regularly quote Scriptures that express their current feelings or trust without claiming the entire passage prophesies their specific situation. Jesus may have been using David's existing prayer to express His own trust in God at that moment.

2. **Request Not to Be Shamed**: The psalm begins, "let me never be put to shame" (verse 1). Yet Jesus was:
   - Mocked by soldiers (Matthew 27:27-31)
   - Publicly stripped naked
   - Crucified between criminals
   - Taunted while dying (Matthew 27:39-44: "He trusts in God; let God deliver him now")

   Jesus experienced profound public shame, contrary to David's request that God prevent such humiliation.

3. **Request for Speedy Rescue**: Verse 2 pleads, "rescue me **speedily**!" David wanted quick deliverance from his enemies. Jesus was:
   - Not rescued from crucifixion
   - Left to die after hours of suffering
   - Not delivered from His enemies' hands

   The psalm asks for rapid rescue, which Jesus did not receive.

4. **Reference to Besieged City**: Verse 21 states, "when I was in a **besieged city**." This describes military siege warfare—a specific historical circumstance. Jesus was:
   - Not in a besieged city
   - Crucified outside Jerusalem's walls
   - In a situation completely unrelated to siege warfare

   This detail anchors the psalm in David's historical military circumstances.

5. **Request to Be Hidden from Enemies' Plots**: Verses 19-20 pray, "In the cover of your presence you hide them from the plots of men; you store them in your shelter from the strife of tongues." David asks God to conceal him from conspiracies and accusations. Jesus was:
   - Not hidden from conspiracies against Him
   - Captured by those plotting His death
   - Publicly tried and executed according to their plots

   God did not shelter Jesus from His enemies' schemes as the psalm requests.

6. **Past Deliverance Described**: Verse 8 gives thanks: "you have not delivered me into the hand of the enemy; you have set my feet in a broad place." David thanks God for past rescue and freedom. Jesus was:
   - Delivered into His enemies' hands
   - Not given freedom ("broad place") but was arrested, tried, and executed
   - Not rescued from His adversaries

   The psalm describes the opposite of Jesus' experience.

7. **David's Personal Prayer**: The superscription identifies this as "A Psalm of David." This is David's prayer amid his own persecution, possibly from Saul or during Absalom's rebellion. The specific details (besieged city, speedy rescue, being hidden from plots, not being delivered to enemies) fit David's historical circumstances, not Jesus' crucifixion.

### Critical

Critical scholars view Psalm 31 as David's personal prayer for deliverance from enemies, requesting quick rescue, protection from shame, and relief from persecution. Jesus quoted one line expressing trust in God, but this represents using existing liturgical language to express faith rather than claiming prophetic fulfillment. People throughout history have quoted this psalm in moments of trial without implying it prophesied their specific situations. The psalm's overall context and specific requests contradict Jesus' experience: David asks not to be shamed (Jesus was shamed), to be rescued speedily (Jesus was not rescued), describes being in a besieged city (Jesus was not), and requests to be hidden from plots (Jesus was publicly executed according to His enemies' plots).

## Conclusion

**Decontextualized fulfillment.** Psalm 31 is David's personal prayer for deliverance from enemies, asking for quick rescue, protection from shame, and relief from persecution. Jesus quoted one line (verse 5) expressing trust in God at the moment of death, but this represents using existing scriptural language to express faith rather than claiming prophetic fulfillment. The psalm's specific details contradict Jesus' experience: David requests not to be put to shame (Jesus was publicly humiliated), speedy rescue (Jesus was not rescued), describes being in a besieged city (Jesus was not), asks to be hidden from enemies' plots (Jesus was publicly tried and executed), and thanks God for not being delivered to enemies (Jesus was delivered to His enemies). No Old Testament author identifies this as messianic prophecy. Quoting a psalm to express current feelings or trust does not transform the entire passage into prophecy about that person. The passage must be extracted from its context as David's historical prayer to apply it as messianic prophecy.
