# Sacrifice and Offering You Did Not Desire

## The Prophecy

Psalm 40 is David's thanksgiving and plea for deliverance:

> I waited patiently for the LORD; he inclined to me and heard my cry. He drew me up from the pit of destruction, out of the miry bog, and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure.
>
> **Sacrifice and offering you have not desired, but you have given me an open ear. Burnt offering and sin offering you have not required. Then I said, "Behold, I have come; in the scroll of the book it is written of me: I delight to do your will, O my God; your law is within my heart."**
>
> I have told the glad news of deliverance in the great congregation; behold, I have not restrained my lips, as you know, O LORD...
>
> **Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me! O LORD, make haste to help me!** Let those be put to shame and disappointed altogether who seek to snatch away my life; let those be turned back and brought to dishonor who delight in my hurt!...
>
> As for me, **I am poor and needy**, but the Lord takes thought for me. You are my help and my deliverer; do not delay, O my God! — Psalm 40:1-17 (selected verses, ESV)

### Apostles

The book of Hebrews applies this psalm to Jesus:

> Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, "**Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body you have prepared for me; in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure. Then I said, 'Behold, I have come to do your will, O God, as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.'"**
>
> When he said above, "You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings" (these are offered according to the law), then he added, "Behold, I have come to do your will." He does away with the first in order to establish the second. — Hebrews 10:5-9 (ESV)

Christians interpret this as:
- **Prophetic of incarnation** - "A body you have prepared for me"
- **Replacing sacrificial system** - Jesus came to fulfill God's will beyond mere sacrifices
- **Written in the scroll** - Prophetic Scripture about the Messiah
- **Willing obedience** - Jesus' submission to God's redemptive plan

The psalm is understood as Jesus speaking prophetically about his incarnation and sacrificial mission.

## Original Context

### Why This Is Misunderstood

1. **The speaker acknowledges personal sin**: Verse 12 says:
   > For evils have encompassed me beyond number; **my iniquities have overtaken me**, and I cannot see; they are more than the hairs of my head; my heart fails me.

   The psalmist confesses his own sins. Jesus had no sin (2 Corinthians 5:21; Hebrews 4:15; 1 Peter 2:22). This cannot be Jesus speaking.

2. **The speaker needs deliverance from sin's consequences**: The psalm repeatedly asks God for rescue from troubles caused by the speaker's iniquities. Jesus didn't need deliverance from consequences of his own sin because he had none.

3. **The speaker asks God to "make haste" to deliver him**: Verses 13 and 17 plead:
   > "O LORD, make haste to help me!"
   > "Do not delay, O my God!"

   Jesus never asked God to hasten his crucifixion or speed up his suffering. His prayer in Gethsemane was "if it be possible, let this cup pass from me" (Matthew 26:39)—the opposite of urging haste.

4. **The speaker describes himself as "poor and needy"**: Verse 17 says, "I am poor and needy." While Jesus lived humbly, this doesn't capture his status. Jesus:
   - Had authority to command angels (Matthew 26:53)
   - Described himself as Lord of the Sabbath (Mark 2:28)
   - Claimed to be the Son of God with all authority (Matthew 28:18)

   "Poor and needy" doesn't fit Jesus' self-understanding.

5. **Hebrews changes the text**: The Septuagint (Greek Old Testament) says "ears you have dug for me" or "you have given me an open ear." Hebrews 10:5 changes this to "**a body you have prepared for me**" to fit the incarnation theology. This is an interpretive paraphrase, not the original Hebrew text.

6. **The psalm is about inward obedience vs. mere ritual**: David contrasts external sacrifices with internal heart obedience. The point is: God desires obedience from the heart, not just ritual. This is a common Old Testament theme (1 Samuel 15:22; Hosea 6:6; Micah 6:6-8). It's not prophesying the end of the sacrificial system.

7. **David wrote this about himself**: The superscription reads "To the choirmaster. A Psalm of David." David is reflecting on God's deliverance from past troubles and confessing his ongoing need for help despite his sins.

## Conclusion

**Misunderstood context.** Psalm 40 is David's personal prayer expressing gratitude for past deliverance and pleading for continued help. The speaker:
- Confesses personal iniquities
- Asks God to hasten deliverance
- Describes himself as poor and needy
- Contrasts external ritual with internal obedience

None of these elements fit Jesus. The psalm teaches that God values obedient hearts over mere ritual—a theme throughout the Old Testament—not that the sacrificial system would be replaced by the Messiah.

The Christian interpretation depends on:
- Ignoring the confession of personal sin in verse 12
- Overlooking that Jesus never asked God to hasten his suffering
- Changing the Hebrew text ("open ear" to "body prepared") to support incarnation theology
- Extracting verses 6-8 while ignoring the surrounding context of personal sin and need
- Assuming a general principle (obedience over ritual) is a specific prophecy about Jesus
