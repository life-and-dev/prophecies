# I Will Open My Mouth in Parables

## The Prophecy

Psalm 78 is a historical recitation of Israel's story:

> Give ear, O my people, to my teaching; incline your ears to the words of my mouth! **I will open my mouth in a parable; I will utter dark sayings from of old, things that we have heard and known, that our fathers have told us.**
>
> **We will not hide them from their children, but tell to the coming generation the glorious deeds of the LORD, and his might, and the wonders that he has done.** He established a testimony in Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers to teach to their children, that the next generation might know them, the children yet unborn, and arise and tell them to their children.
>
> So that they should set their hope in God and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments; and that they should not be like their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation...
>
> [The psalm then recounts Israel's history: the Exodus, wilderness wandering, entering the Promised Land, the rebellion of Israel, God's judgment, and the choosing of David as king—spanning verses 12-72.]

### Apostles

Matthew quotes this psalm and applies it to Jesus:

> All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed, he said nothing to them without a parable. This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet: "**I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world.**" — Matthew 13:34-35 (ESV)

Christians interpret this as:
- **"Open my mouth in parables"** - Jesus' distinctive teaching method
- **"Utter what has been hidden"** - Jesus revealing mysteries of the kingdom
- **"From of old/foundation of the world"** - Eternal truths revealed through Jesus

The psalm is understood as prophesying that the Messiah would teach in parables.

## Original Context

### Why This Is Misunderstood

1. **The psalm is about recounting Israel's history**: The "parable" and "dark sayings from of old" refer to the lessons from Israel's past—the Exodus, wilderness wandering, conquest, and monarchy. The psalmist says:
   - "Things that we have heard and known, that **our fathers have told us**"
   - "Tell to the coming generation **the glorious deeds of the LORD**"
   - "The wonders that **he has done**"

   This is about teaching Israel's history, not prophesying the Messiah's teaching style.

2. **The entire psalm (vv. 12-72) is the "parable"**: After announcing he will "open my mouth in a parable," the psalmist proceeds to recount:
   - The Exodus and plagues in Egypt (vv. 12-16)
   - Israel's rebellion in the wilderness (vv. 17-42)
   - More miracles in Egypt (vv. 43-55)
   - Israel's repeated disobedience (vv. 56-64)
   - God choosing Judah and David (vv. 65-72)

   These historical events are the "parable"—using history to teach spiritual lessons.

3. **"Parable" (mashal) means wisdom teaching or lesson**: The Hebrew word *mashal* doesn't exclusively mean "short story" as in Jesus' parables. It means:
   - Proverb or wise saying
   - Comparison or analogy
   - Instructive poem
   - Historical lesson

   The psalmist uses Israel's history as a lesson (*mashal*) for future generations. This is wisdom literature, not prophecy about a teaching method.

4. **Many prophets taught using parables/analogies**: Teaching through stories and analogies was common among Israel's prophets and sages:
   - Nathan's parable to David (2 Samuel 12:1-4)
   - Isaiah's vineyard song (Isaiah 5:1-7)
   - Ezekiel's allegories (Ezekiel 17:2-10; 24:3-5)
   - Wisdom literature (Proverbs, Ecclesiastes)

   Using parables wasn't unique to Jesus or prophesied as a distinctive messianic sign.

5. **The purpose is teaching God's deeds, not revealing new mysteries**: Verse 4 says the goal is to "tell to the coming generation **the glorious deeds of the LORD, and his might, and the wonders that he has done**." This is about:
   - Preserving Israel's historical memory
   - Teaching about God's past actions
   - Warning against repeating Israel's mistakes

   Jesus' parables revealed "mysteries of the kingdom" (Matthew 13:11)—new revelations. The psalm teaches about God's already-known deeds in history.

6. **Matthew slightly alters the quote**:
   - **Psalm**: "dark sayings **from of old**" (referring to ancient history)
   - **Matthew**: "what has been hidden **since the foundation of the world**"

   Matthew interprets the psalm through a lens of revelation theology, but the original psalm refers to historical events "from of old" that were already known and passed down through generations.

7. **The psalm explicitly says these things were already known**: Verse 3: "things that **we have heard and known**, that our fathers have told us." The psalm isn't about revealing hidden mysteries but about passing on already-known history. Jesus' parables revealed things "kept secret from the foundation of the world" (Matthew 13:35)—a different concept.

## Conclusion

**Misunderstood context.** Psalm 78 is a historical wisdom psalm that uses Israel's past (the "parable" or *mashal*) to teach spiritual lessons to future generations. The psalmist recounts the Exodus, wilderness wandering, and Israel's repeated rebellion to warn against disobedience and encourage faithfulness.

Teaching through parables/analogies was common among Israel's prophets and wisdom teachers. The psalm doesn't predict that the Messiah would use this method; rather, it employs the method itself to teach history.

The Christian interpretation depends on:
- Isolating verses 1-2 from the 70+ verses of historical recitation that follow
- Reading *mashal* (wisdom teaching/lesson) as exclusively referring to Jesus' parable style
- Ignoring that the psalm teaches known history, while Jesus revealed hidden mysteries
- Treating a common teaching method as a unique messianic prophecy
- Overlooking that many prophets before Jesus taught using parables and analogies
