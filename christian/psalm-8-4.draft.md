# What Is Man That You Are Mindful of Him?

## The Prophecy

> O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! You have set your glory above the heavens. Out of the mouth of **babes and infants**, you have established strength because of your foes, to still the enemy and the avenger. When I look at your heavens, the work of your fingers, the moon and the stars, which you have set in place, **what is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him? Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor. You have given him dominion over the works of your hands; you have put all things under his feet**, all sheep and oxen, and also the beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, whatever passes along the paths of the seas. O LORD, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth! — Psalm 8:1-9 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

The book of Hebrews quotes this passage and applies it to Jesus:

> For it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking. It has been testified somewhere, **"What is man, that you are mindful of him, or the son of man, that you care for him? You made him for a little while lower than the angels; you have crowned him with glory and honor, putting everything in subjection under his feet."** Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. At present, **we do not yet see everything in subjection to him**. But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely **Jesus**, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone. — Hebrews 2:5-9 (ESV)

### Christian

Christians interpret this as prophesying Jesus' authority over creation, arguing that:

- "Son of man" was Jesus' self-designation throughout the Gospels
- "Made lower than the angels" refers to Jesus' incarnation and humiliation
- "Crowned with glory and honor" describes Jesus' resurrection and exaltation
- "All things under his feet" points to Jesus' ultimate authority over all creation

The passage is understood as prophesying Jesus' dominion over all creation as the perfect human and second Adam.

**Hebrews' Application**: The author of Hebrews explicitly applies this passage to Jesus, acknowledging that "we do not yet see everything in subjection to him" but pointing to Jesus who was "crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death" (Hebrews 2:8-9). This represents authoritative apostolic interpretation revealing deeper messianic meaning in the psalm.

**Typological Fulfillment**: Christians view Jesus as the ideal human, the "second Adam" (Romans 5:12-21; 1 Corinthians 15:45-49) who perfectly fulfills humanity's original created purpose. What was intended for all humanity in Genesis 1:26-28 finds its perfect realization in Jesus, who will ultimately exercise dominion over all creation.

However, several contextual factors challenge viewing this as original prophecy:

1. **Plural References**: The psalm refers to "**babes and infants**" (plural, verse 2), suggesting it addresses humans generally, not exclusively one person. This is a psalm celebrating humanity's collective place in creation, not singling out one individual.

2. **Universal Human Experience**: The psalm describes attributes that apply to all humans, not uniquely to Jesus. Humans generally exercise dominion over animals and nature through farming, animal husbandry, fishing, and environmental stewardship. These are universal human activities reflecting the creation mandate.

3. **"Son of Man" as Poetic Parallelism**: In Hebrew poetry, "son of man" (*ben adam*) functions as synonymous parallelism with "man" (*enosh*)—a poetic device meaning simply "human being." The verse asks "what is man... and the son of man" using two parallel terms for humanity, not presenting "son of man" as a distinct messianic title. While Jesus later adopted "Son of Man" as a self-designation, Psalm 8 uses it generically for humans.

4. **David's Meditation on Humanity**: The psalm is attributed to David (superscription) and expresses wonder at God's care for humanity despite human smallness compared to the vastness of creation. It meditates on the dignity God granted to all humans, not a prophecy about one future individual.

5. **Genesis Creation Account**: The psalm clearly echoes Genesis 1:26-28 where God gave humanity (collectively) dominion over creation:
   > Then God said, "Let us make man in our image, after our likeness. And **let them have dominion** over the fish of the sea and over the birds of the heavens and over the livestock and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth." — Genesis 1:26 (ESV)

   Psalm 8 celebrates this universal human mandate, not a specific messianic prophecy.

6. **Nothing Unique to Jesus**: Every element mentioned—being made lower than angels (humans are not angelic beings), having dominion over animals, being crowned with honor—applies to humans generally according to the creation narrative. The psalm celebrates what God gave to all humanity at creation.

7. **Hebrews Acknowledges Incomplete Fulfillment**: Hebrews 2:8 admits, "At present, **we do not yet see everything in subjection to him**." The promised dominion over all things has not yet been realized, even in Jesus. This requires future eschatological fulfillment.

### Critical

Critical scholars view Psalm 8 as a meditation on human dignity and God's care for humanity, reflecting on the creation mandate in Genesis 1:26-28. The psalm celebrates what God gave to all humanity—being made in God's image, crowned with glory and honor, and granted dominion over creation. The "son of man" is Hebrew poetic parallelism for "human being," not a messianic title. Hebrews later applies this passage to Jesus using typological interpretation—seeing Jesus as the ideal human who will perfectly fulfill humanity's created purpose—but this represents theological application rather than the psalm's original prophetic intent. No Old Testament author identifies this as messianic prophecy.

## Conclusion

**Decontextualized fulfillment.** Psalm 8 is a meditation on human dignity and God's care for humanity, celebrating the creation mandate given to all humans in Genesis 1:26-28. The psalm is attributed to David and expresses wonder at God granting humanity (collectively) dominion over creation despite human smallness compared to the vast universe. The passage uses plural references ("babes and infants"), describes universal human experiences (dominion over animals), and employs "son of man" as Hebrew poetic parallelism for "human being" rather than a messianic title. Every element mentioned—being made lower than angels, having dominion over animals, being crowned with honor—applies to humans generally according to the creation narrative. While Christians can legitimately apply the psalm's themes to Jesus typologically as the perfect human and second Adam who will ultimately fulfill humanity's created purpose, the original context clearly addresses humanity collectively. Hebrews applies this to Jesus through typological interpretation, acknowledging that "we do not yet see everything in subjection to him," requiring future eschatological fulfillment. No Old Testament author identifies this as messianic prophecy. The passage must be extracted from its context celebrating universal human dignity to apply it exclusively to Jesus.
