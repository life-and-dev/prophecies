# I Said, You Are Gods

## The Prophecy

Psalm 82 is a prophetic critique of unjust judges:

> God has taken his place in the divine council; in the midst of the gods he holds judgment: "How long will you judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked?
>
> Give justice to the weak and the fatherless; maintain the right of the afflicted and the destitute. Rescue the weak and the needy; deliver them from the hand of the wicked."
>
> They have neither knowledge nor understanding, they walk about in darkness; all the foundations of the earth are shaken.
>
> **I said, "You are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you; nevertheless, like men you shall die, and fall like any prince."**
>
> Arise, O God, judge the earth; for you shall inherit all the nations! — Psalm 82:1-8 (ESV)

### Apostles

Jesus quoted this psalm when defending himself against accusations of blasphemy:

> The Jews answered him, "It is not for a good work that we are going to stone you but for blasphemy, because you, being a man, make yourself God." **Jesus answered them, "Is it not written in your Law, 'I said, you are gods'? If he called them gods to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be broken—do you say of him whom the Father consecrated and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God'?"** — John 10:33-36 (ESV)

Christians sometimes interpret this as:
- **Jesus claiming divinity** - Using the psalm to justify being called "God"
- **Humans can be called "gods"** - Therefore Jesus, being greater, can certainly be called God
- **"Sons of the Most High"** - Supporting Jesus' claim to be "Son of God"

However, this interpretation misses Jesus' actual argument.

## Original Context

### Why This Is Misunderstood

1. **The psalm addresses unjust human judges**: The "gods" in Psalm 82 are:
   - Human judges and rulers
   - Those who "judge unjustly and show partiality to the wicked" (v. 2)
   - Leaders who fail to protect the weak and needy (vv. 3-4)
   - Mortals who "shall die, and fall like any prince" (v. 7)

   The psalm calls out corrupt leadership, not divine beings.

2. **"Gods" (elohim) was a title for judges with authority**: In ancient Israel, judges were sometimes called *elohim* (gods) because they:
   - Exercised God-given authority
   - Made life-and-death decisions
   - Represented God's justice

   Exodus 21:6 and 22:8-9 use *elohim* for human judges. This was a title of authority, not literal divinity.

3. **The psalm emphasizes they are mortal**: Verse 6-7: "I said, 'You are gods'... **nevertheless, like men you shall die**, and fall like any prince." The point is:
   - Despite their lofty title and authority
   - They are still mortal humans
   - They will face judgment

   The psalm contrasts their title with their mortality—they're called "gods" but they're just men who will die.

4. **Jesus' argument proves his accusers wrong about blasphemy**: Jesus wasn't claiming the psalm justified his deity. His argument was:
   - Scripture calls corrupt human judges "gods" and "sons of the Most High"
   - These were ordinary, sinful humans
   - Yet Scripture (which "cannot be broken") used divine language for them
   - Therefore, if they could be called "gods" without it being blasphemous
   - Then Jesus calling himself "Son of God" (a lesser claim) cannot be blasphemous
   - Especially since he is consecrated and sent by God, unlike the corrupt judges

   Jesus' logic: "If those corrupt humans could be called 'gods,' surely I can be called 'Son of God.'"

5. **Jesus argues from lesser to greater**: The reasoning is:
   - Lesser: Sinful human judges were called "gods"
   - Greater: Jesus, consecrated and sent by God, calls himself "Son of God"
   - Conclusion: If the lesser wasn't blasphemy, the greater isn't either

   Jesus isn't claiming to be God based on this psalm; he's defending himself from the charge of blasphemy.

6. **"Son of God" is a lesser title than "God"**: Jesus carefully says "I said, 'I am the **Son of God**'"—not "I am God." His argument is that:
   - Psalm 82 calls humans "gods" (plural, *elohim*)
   - He only called himself "Son of God" (a filial relationship term)
   - If humans can be "gods," surely he can be "Son of God"

   This is a defense against blasphemy charges, not an assertion of deity equal to the Father.

7. **The psalm is not messianic**: Psalm 82 doesn't prophesy anything about the Messiah. It critiques unjust judges in the psalmist's time (or generally). Jesus used it as an analogy to defend himself, not claiming it was about him.

## Conclusion

**Misunderstood context.** Psalm 82 is a prophetic critique of corrupt human judges who abuse their authority. These judges are called "gods" (*elohim*) because of their judicial authority, but the psalm emphasizes they are mortal and will face divine judgment for their injustice.

Jesus quoted this psalm not as a messianic prophecy, but as a defense against blasphemy charges. His argument was: "If Scripture calls corrupt human judges 'gods' without it being blasphemous, then my claim to be 'Son of God'—a lesser title—cannot be blasphemy."

Ironically, Christians often misuse this passage to support Jesus' deity, when Jesus' actual argument was:
- Human judges were called "gods"
- Therefore calling himself "Son of God" (a lesser claim) is not blasphemous
- This is an argument from lesser to greater

The Christian interpretation depends on:
- Misunderstanding Jesus' actual argument in John 10
- Ignoring that Jesus argued these were ordinary humans called "gods"
- Missing that Jesus contrasted "gods" (plural, for humans) with "Son of God" (his own lesser claim)
- Treating Jesus' defense against blasphemy as if it were an assertion of deity
- Overlooking that the psalm explicitly says these "gods" are mortal humans who will die
