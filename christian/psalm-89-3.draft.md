# Covenant with My Chosen, David

## The Prophecy

> I will sing of the steadfast love of the LORD, forever; with my mouth I will make known your faithfulness to all generations... You have said, **"I have made a covenant with my chosen one; I have sworn to David my servant: 'I will establish your offspring forever, and build your throne for all generations.'"** Of old you spoke in a vision to your godly one, and said: "I have granted help to one who is mighty; I have exalted one chosen from the people. I have found David, my servant; with my holy oil I have anointed him, so that my hand shall be established with him; my arm also shall strengthen him..." **He shall cry to me, 'You are my Father, my God, and the Rock of my salvation.' And I will make him the firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth.** My steadfast love I will keep for him forever, and my covenant will stand firm for him. **I will establish his offspring forever, and his throne as the days of the heavens. If his sons forsake my law and do not walk according to my rules, if they violate my statutes and do not keep my commandments, then I will punish their transgression with the rod and their iniquity with stripes, but I will not remove from him my steadfast love or be false to my faithfulness.** I will not violate my covenant or alter the word that went forth from my lips. Once for all I have sworn by my holiness; I will not lie to David. His offspring shall endure forever, his throne as long as the sun before me. — Psalm 89:1-36 (ESV, selected verses)

## Fulfillment

### Christian

Christians interpret this psalm as referring to Jesus, arguing that:

- "Your offspring forever" refers to Jesus as David's ultimate descendant
- "I will make him the firstborn" indicates Jesus as the preeminent One
- "Highest of the kings of the earth" describes Jesus' supreme authority
- "You are my Father" points to Jesus' unique sonship with God
- The eternal throne refers to Jesus' everlasting kingdom

The psalm is understood as prophesying the Messiah's eternal reign as David's descendant.

However, several contextual factors challenge this interpretation:

1. **Covenant Addressed to David About His Descendants**: The covenant is explicitly made with David concerning his lineage:
   - "I have sworn to **David my servant**"
   - "I will establish **your offspring** forever"
   - "**His sons**" (verse 30)

   This is God's covenant with David about his dynastic lineage through multiple generations, not a specific prophecy about one individual future Messiah.

2. **Conditional Covenant for "His Sons" (Plural)**: Verses 30-32 state conditional terms:
   > **If his sons forsake my law** and do not walk according to my rules, if they violate my statutes and do not keep my commandments, **then I will punish their transgression** with the rod and their iniquity with stripes.

   The covenant includes:
   - Conditional obedience required from David's sons (plural)
   - Punishment specified for disobedience
   - Multiple descendants implied throughout

   This describes an ongoing dynasty spanning multiple generations, not one individual.

3. **Jesus Had No Biological Children**: The psalm repeatedly speaks about:
   - "His offspring" (descendants)
   - "His sons" (plural)
   - Establishing "his throne for all generations"

   Jesus had no biological children to establish a throne or continue a dynasty. The language assumes multiple generations of biological descendants ruling in succession.

4. **Historical Fulfillment in David's Actual Sons**: The conditional language ("if his sons forsake my law... I will punish their transgression") describes what actually occurred historically:
   - Solomon sinned, leading to the kingdom's division (1 Kings 11)
   - Many of David's descendants were wicked and received divine punishment
   - The Davidic dynasty eventually ended with the Babylonian exile

   This addresses David's actual historical sons and descendants, not exclusively Jesus.

5. **"Firstborn" and "Highest of Kings" as Status Language**: Verse 27 states, "I will make him the firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth." In context:
   - David was not literally God's firstborn son
   - "Firstborn" signifies preeminence or favored status (like Ephraim in Jeremiah 31:9)
   - "Highest of the kings" means David and his dynasty would be exalted above other earthly kingdoms

   This is royal court language emphasizing David's dynasty's preeminence, not necessarily prophesying a divine Messiah.

6. **Latter Part Laments Covenant's Apparent Failure**: Verses 38-51 express profound anguish that God seems to have broken the covenant:
   > But now you have cast off and rejected; you are full of wrath against your anointed. You have renounced the covenant with your servant; you have defiled his crown in the dust. (verses 38-39)

   The psalmist questions why the Davidic kingdom has fallen despite God's promises. This reflects historical reality—the dynasty's collapse during the Babylonian conquest—not a prophecy awaiting distant fulfillment in Jesus.

7. **Recounts Existing Covenant, Not New Prophecy**: This psalm poetically reflects on God's covenant with David originally recorded in 2 Samuel 7:12-16, which is the primary Davidic covenant passage. Psalm 89 is not an additional prophecy but a poetic meditation on that existing covenant, questioning why it appears to have failed given the dynasty's collapse.

### Critical

Critical scholars view Psalm 89 as a poetic meditation on God's covenant with David recorded in 2 Samuel 7, reflecting on the promises God made to establish David's dynasty forever and the conditions attached (his sons must obey or face punishment). The latter portion laments that the covenant seems broken due to the Davidic kingdom's collapse during the Babylonian exile. The psalm addresses David and his many descendants ("his sons"), describing an ongoing dynasty through multiple generations with conditional obedience and punishment for disobedience. The language about "his sons" (plural), conditions for obedience, and Jesus having no biological children to establish a dynasty all point to this being about David's historical descendants collectively, not one future Messiah exclusively.

## Conclusion

**Decontextualized fulfillment.** Psalm 89 is a poetic meditation on God's covenant with David, originally established in 2 Samuel 7, concerning his ongoing dynasty through multiple generations. The psalm explicitly addresses David and "his sons" (plural), includes conditional language about obedience and punishment for disobedience, and the latter portion laments the covenant's apparent failure when the Davidic dynasty collapsed. The language assumes multiple generations of biological descendants ruling in succession, which Jesus did not fulfill as He had no biological children to establish a throne. The conditional language about "his sons" forsaking God's law and receiving punishment describes the historical reality of David's actual descendants—Solomon's idolatry leading to kingdom division, many wicked kings, and eventual Babylonian exile. The phrase "firstborn, highest of kings" uses royal court language about David's dynasty's preeminence among earthly kingdoms rather than necessarily prophesying divine messiahship. No Old Testament author identifies this psalm as exclusively messianic prophecy; it recounts the existing Davidic covenant. The passage must be extracted from its context about David's ongoing dynasty with multiple sons to apply it exclusively to one future Messiah.
