# Angels Will Guard You in All Your Ways

Psalm 91 is one of the most beloved passages in the Bible, often recited for comfort and protection in times of trouble. Its vivid imagery of angelic guardians and divine safety has led some to interpret it as a specific messianic prophecy, especially given its role in the temptation of Jesus. However, a closer examination of the psalm's context and Jesus' own life raises significant questions about this traditional application. Does Psalm 91 truly predict the experience of the Messiah, or is it a broader promise of trust for all believers?

## Psalm 91 Passage

> He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say to the LORD, "My refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust." For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence. He will cover you with his pinions, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness is a shield and buckler. You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day, nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor the destruction that wastes at noonday... Because you have made the LORD your dwelling place—the Most High, who is my refuge—no evil shall be allowed to befall you, no plague come near your tent. **For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways. On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.** You will tread on the lion and the adder; the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot. "Because he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him; I will protect him, because he knows my name. When he calls to me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will rescue him and honor him. **With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation.**" — Psalm 91:1-16 (ESV)

## Wilderness Temptation

Satan quoted this psalm when tempting Jesus in the wilderness:

> Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, **'He will command his angels concerning you,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'**" Jesus said to him, "Again it is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" — Matthew 4:5-7 (ESV)

## Messianic View

Some Christians interpret this passage as messianic prophecy, arguing that:

- Satan recognized this psalm referred to the Messiah.
- God provided supernatural angelic protection for Jesus.
- Jesus demonstrated authority over evil by trampling serpents and lions.

## Universal Application

The psalm opens with conditional language addressing anyone who trusts God: "**He who dwells** in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty." This is a general promise for any believer, not exclusively for the Messiah.

## Jesus' Response

When Satan quoted this psalm, Jesus rebuked him for testing God (Matthew 4:7) rather than affirming the passage applied to himself. Jesus' rejection of Satan's application suggests he did not view this psalm as specifically messianic.

## Life Span Contradiction

The psalm explicitly promises, "**With long life I will satisfy him** and show him my salvation" (Psalm 91:16). Jesus lived approximately 33 years. This was not considered a long life in ancient times when people regularly lived 70 or 80 years as noted in Psalm 90:10. His life was cut short by crucifixion.

## Protection from Harm

The psalm repeatedly promises deliverance from snares, pestilence, arrows, terror, and destruction. It states "no evil shall be allowed to befall you" and "I will deliver him; I will protect him; I will rescue him and honor him." Yet Jesus was arrested, beaten, mocked, and crucified. This was the opposite of protection from evil.

## Salvation for the Subject

The psalm promises to "show him my salvation," but Jesus is the Savior who provides salvation for others. He is not one who needs to receive it for himself.

## Literary Genre

Psalm 91 is wisdom literature offering encouragement to all believers who trust God. Like other wisdom psalms, it presents an idealized picture of divine protection meant to encourage faith. It does not guarantee absolute immunity from suffering. Other psalms, such as Psalm 3:1-2, 73:2-3, acknowledge the reality of life's dangers and the suffering of the righteous. History demonstrates many faithful people suffered, including Job, the prophets, and martyrs.

## Satanic Misapplication

If this psalm were clearly and exclusively messianic, Satan's temptation would be nonsensical. Satan was testing whether Jesus would presume upon God's protection. The fact this was presented as a test indicates the psalm was understood as a general promise that Satan attempted to get Jesus to misapply.

## Scholarly Perspectives

Critical scholars view Psalm 91 as a psalm of trust and protection addressed to any believer, not a messianic prophecy. This perspective highlights the general conditional phrasing applicable to any faithful person. The promises of long life, protection from harm, and being shown salvation are incompatible with Jesus' historical experience. Jesus' rejection of Satan's application during the temptation further undermines claims of messianic fulfillment. Commentaries like [BibleRef](https://www.bibleref.com/Psalms/91/Psalm-91-11.html) emphasize that while the psalm has messianic implications in the New Testament, it does not guarantee absolute immunity from suffering for all who demand it.

## Conclusion

Psalm 91 is a [wisdom psalm](#literary-genre) offering encouragement to anyone who trusts in God. It promises [divine protection](#protection-from-harm) and [long life](#life-span-contradiction) to the faithful. However, its [universal language](#universal-application) and the contradiction between its promises and [Jesus' actual experience](#protection-from-harm) suggest it was not intended as a specific messianic prophecy. Jesus himself [rejected](#jesus-response) the [Satanic misapplication](#satanic-misapplication) of these verses during his temptation.
