# Angels Will Guard You in All Your Ways

## The Prophecy

> He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say to the LORD, "My refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust." For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence. He will cover you with his pinions, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness is a shield and buckler. You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day, nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor the destruction that wastes at noonday... Because you have made the LORD your dwelling place—the Most High, who is my refuge—no evil shall be allowed to befall you, no plague come near your tent. **For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways. On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.** You will tread on the lion and the adder; the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot. "Because he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him; I will protect him, because he knows my name. When he calls to me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will rescue him and honor him. **With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation.**" — Psalm 91:1-16 (ESV, selected verses)

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

Satan quoted this psalm when tempting Jesus in the wilderness:

> Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, **'He will command his angels concerning you,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'**" Jesus said to him, "Again it is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" — Matthew 4:5-7 (ESV)

### Christian

Some Christians interpret this passage as messianic prophecy, arguing that:

- Satan recognized this psalm referred to the Messiah
- God provided supernatural angelic protection for Jesus
- Jesus demonstrated authority over evil by trampling serpents and lions

However, several factors challenge this interpretation:

1. **Universal Application**: The psalm opens with conditional language addressing anyone who trusts God: "**He who dwells** in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty." This is a general promise for any believer, not exclusively for the Messiah.

2. **Jesus' Response**: When Satan quoted this psalm, Jesus rebuked him for testing God (Matthew 4:7) rather than affirming the passage applied to himself. Jesus' rejection of Satan's application suggests he did not view this psalm as specifically messianic.

3. **Long Life Promise**: The psalm explicitly promises, "**With long life I will satisfy him** and show him my salvation" (Psalm 91:16). Jesus lived approximately 33 years, which was not considered a long life in ancient times when people regularly lived 70-80 years (Psalm 90:10). His life was cut short by crucifixion.

4. **Protection from Harm**: The psalm repeatedly promises deliverance from snares, pestilence, arrows, terror, and destruction, stating "no evil shall be allowed to befall you" and "I will deliver him; I will protect him; I will rescue him and honor him." Yet Jesus was arrested, beaten, mocked, and crucified—the opposite of protection from evil.

5. **Salvation for the Subject**: The psalm promises to "show him my salvation," but Jesus is the Savior who provides salvation for others, not one who needs to receive it for himself.

6. **Literary Genre**: Psalm 91 is wisdom literature offering encouragement to all believers who trust God. Like other wisdom psalms, it presents an idealized picture of divine protection meant to encourage faith, not guarantee absolute immunity from suffering. History demonstrates many faithful people suffered (Job, the prophets, martyrs).

7. **Satan's Use as Evidence**: If this psalm were clearly and exclusively messianic, Satan's temptation would be nonsensical. Satan was testing whether Jesus would presume upon God's protection. The fact this was presented as a test indicates the psalm was understood as a general promise that Satan attempted to get Jesus to misapply.

### Critical

Critical scholars view Psalm 91 as a psalm of trust and protection addressed to any believer, not a messianic prophecy. The psalm uses general conditional language ("he who dwells," "you will not fear") applicable to any faithful person. The promises of long life, protection from harm, and being shown salvation are incompatible with Jesus' historical experience. Jesus' rejection of Satan's application during the temptation further undermines claims of messianic fulfillment.

## Conclusion

**Decontextualized fulfillment.** Psalm 91 is a wisdom psalm offering encouragement to anyone who trusts in God, promising divine protection and long life to the faithful. The psalm's universal language, Jesus' explicit rejection of its application during Satan's temptation, and the contradiction between its promises (long life, protection from harm, being shown salvation) and Jesus' actual experience (brief life, crucifixion, being the Savior rather than needing salvation) demonstrate this passage was not a messianic prophecy. The passage must be taken out of its literary and contextual framework to apply it to Jesus. No Old Testament or New Testament author explicitly identifies this psalm as messianic prophecy.
