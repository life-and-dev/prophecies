# Psalm 91:11-12 (Guarding Angels)

Psalm 91 is one of the most beloved passages in the Bible, often recited for comfort and protection. However, its interpretation becomes complex when applied to the life of Jesus. While some see it as a direct prophecy about the Messiah, others find significant contradictions between its promises and Jesus' actual experiences. What does this psalm truly promise, and how does it relate to the figure of the Messiah?

## The Divine Promises of Protection in Psalm 91

The psalmist uses vivid imagery to describe God's care.

> **He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High** shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
> 
> I will say of the LORD, “He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in Him I will trust.”
> 
> Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the perilous pestilence.
> 
> He shall cover you with His feathers, and under His wings you shall take refuge;
> His truth shall be your shield and buckler.
>
> You shall not be afraid of the terror by night,  
> nor of the arrow that flies by day,  
> nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness,  
> nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday.
> 
> **A thousand may fall at your side**, and **ten thousand at your right hand**; But it **shall not come near you**. Only with your eyes shall you look, and see the reward of the wicked.
> 
> Because you have made the LORD, Who is my refuge, even the Most High, your dwelling place, no evil shall befall you, nor shall any plague come near your dwelling; 
> 
> ***For He shall give His angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways. In their hands they shall bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone.**
>
> You shall tread upon the lion and the cobra, the young lion and the serpent you shall trample underfoot.
> 
> “Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set him on high, because he has known My name. He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honor him. **With long life I will satisfy him, and show him My salvation.**”

## Perspectives on Messianic Fulfillment

### The Wilderness Temptation of Jesus

Satan quoted this psalm when tempting Jesus in the wilderness:

> Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, "If you are [the Son of God](https://son.ofgod.info), throw yourself down, for it is written, 
> 
>> 'He will command his angels concerning you,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'" 
>
> Jesus said to him, "Again it is written, 
> 
>> 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" 
>
> — Matthew 4:5-7 (ESV)

### Traditional Christian Interpretations

Some Christians interpret this passage as messianic prophecy. A messianic prophecy is a prediction about a future savior. They argue that:

- Satan recognized this psalm referred to the Messiah
- God provided supernatural angelic protection for Jesus (Matthew 4:11)

However, several factors challenge this interpretation:

#### Universal Application

The psalm opens with conditional language addressing anyone who trusts God: "**He who dwells** in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty." This is a general promise for any believer. It is not exclusively for the Messiah.

#### Jesus' Response

When Satan quoted this psalm, Jesus rebuked him for testing God. He quoted Deuteronomy 6:16 in response. He did not affirm the passage applied to himself. Jesus' rejection of Satan's application suggests he did not view this psalm as specifically messianic.

#### Testing God vs. Fulfilling Prophecy

If this passage were a specific prophecy about the Messiah, intentionally jumping would be an act of fulfilling God's word, not testing Him. A prophecy is a prediction of what *will* happen; obeying it is faithfulness. However, Jesus refused to jump, identifying the act as "testing God" (Matthew 4:7). This distinction is crucial: Jesus treated the verse as a general promise of protection for the faithful (one that relies on God's sovereignty and cannot be forced or manipulated) rather than a specific script or mechanical guarantee for the Messiah.

#### Long Life Promise

The psalm explicitly promises, "**With long life I will satisfy him** and show him my salvation" (Psalm 91:16). Jesus lived approximately 33 years. This was not considered a long life in ancient times. People regularly lived 70 to 80 years according to Psalm 90:10. His life was cut short by crucifixion.

#### Protection from Harm

The psalm repeatedly promises deliverance from snares, pestilence, arrows, terror, and destruction. It states "no evil shall be allowed to befall you." It also says "I will deliver him; I will protect him; I will rescue him and honor him." Yet Jesus was arrested, beaten, mocked, and crucified. This was the opposite of protection from evil.

#### Wicked Fall

The psalm promises that "**a thousand may fall at your side**, and **ten thousand at your right hand**; But it **shall not come near you**" (Psalm 91:7). However, Jesus was not delivered from the wicked at his crucifixion. His enemies did not "fall," and they certainly "came near" him.

#### Salvation for the Subject

The psalm promises to "show him my salvation." Jesus is the Savior who provides salvation for others. He is not one who needs to receive it for himself.

#### Literary Genre

Psalm 91 is often classified as a [psalm of trust](https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/psalm-91/). It offers encouragement to all believers who trust God. Like other wisdom psalms, it presents an idealized picture of divine protection. This is meant to encourage faith. It does not guarantee absolute immunity from suffering. History demonstrates many faithful people suffered. Job, the prophets, and martyrs are clear examples.

#### Satan's Use as Evidence

If this passage were a specific prophecy about the Messiah, intentionally jumping would be an act of fulfilling God's word, not testing Him. A prophecy is a prediction of what *will* happen; obeying it is faithfulness. However, Jesus refused to jump, identifying the act as "testing God" (Matthew 4:7). This distinction is crucial: Jesus treated the verse as a general promise of protection for the faithful (one that relies on God's sovereignty and cannot be forced or manipulated) rather than a specific script or mechanical guarantee for the Messiah.

### Critical Scholarly Perspectives

Critical scholars view Psalm 91 as a psalm of trust and protection addressed to any believer. They do not see it as a messianic prophecy. The psalm uses general conditional language applicable to any faithful person. The promises of long life, protection from harm, and being shown salvation are incompatible with Jesus' historical experience. Jesus' rejection of Satan's application during the temptation further undermines claims of messianic fulfillment.

#### Scholarly Criticisms and Defenses

Some scholars argue that "long life" is satisfied by Jesus' eternal life or resurrection. However, the psalm's context refers to earthly longevity and protection from physical death. This is seen in the contrast with the "thousand falling at your side." Interpreting it as eternal life requires a spiritualized reading that departs from the plain meaning of the wisdom tradition.

Others suggest that Jesus' suffering was a temporary "snare" and his ultimate victory fulfills the protection. Yet the psalm says "no evil shall be allowed to befall you." It implies a shield against the experience of suffering itself. It is not just an ultimate rescue after suffering.

## Conclusion

Psalm 91 is a psalm offering encouragement to anyone who trusts in God, promising divine protection and long life to the faithful. The psalm's universal language, Jesus' explicit rejection of its application during Satan's temptation, and the contradiction between its promises (long life, protection from harm, being shown salvation) and Jesus' actual experience (brief life, crucifixion, being the Savior rather than needing salvation) demonstrate this passage was not a messianic prophecy. The passage must be taken out of its literary and contextual framework to apply it to Jesus. No Old Testament or New Testament author explicitly identifies this psalm as messianic prophecy.
