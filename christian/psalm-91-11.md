# Psalm 91:11-12 (Guarding Angels)

## The Prophecy

> **He who dwells in the secret place of the Most High** shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty.
> 
> I will say of the LORD, “He is my refuge and my fortress; My God, in Him I will trust.”
> 
> Surely He shall deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the perilous pestilence.
> 
> He shall cover you with His feathers, and under His wings you shall take refuge;
> His truth shall be your shield and buckler.
>
> You shall not be afraid of the terror by night,  
> nor of the arrow that flies by day,  
> nor of the pestilence that walks in darkness,  
> nor of the destruction that lays waste at noonday.
> 
> **A thousand may fall at your side**, and **ten thousand at your right hand**; But it **shall not come near you**. Only with your eyes shall you look, and see the reward of the wicked.
> 
> Because you have made the LORD, Who is my refuge, even the Most High, your dwelling place, no evil shall befall you, nor shall any plague come near your dwelling; 
> 
> ***For He shall give His angels charge over you, to keep you in all your ways. In their hands they shall bear you up, lest you dash your foot against a stone.**
>
> You shall tread upon the lion and the cobra, the young lion and the serpent you shall trample underfoot.
> 
> “Because he has set his love upon Me, therefore I will deliver him; I will set him on high, because he has known My name. He shall call upon Me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will deliver him and honor him. **With long life I will satisfy him, and show him My salvation.**”
>
> — Psalm 91

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

Satan quoted this psalm when tempting Jesus in the wilderness:

> Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, "If you are [the Son of God](https://son.ofgod.info), throw yourself down, for it is written, 
> 
>> 'He will command his angels concerning you,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'" 
>
> Jesus said to him, "Again it is written, 
> 
>> 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" 
>
> — Matthew 4:5-7 (ESV)

### Christian

Some Christians interpret this passage as messianic prophecy, arguing that:

- Satan recognized this psalm referred to the Messiah
- God provided supernatural angelic protection for Jesus (Matthew 4:11)

However, several factors challenge this interpretation:

1. **Universal Application**: The psalm opens with conditional language addressing anyone who trusts God: "**He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High** will abide in the shadow of the Almighty." This is a general promise for any believer, not exclusively for the Messiah.
2. **Jesus' Response**: When Satan quoted this psalm, Jesus rebuked him for testing God (Matthew 4:7) rather than affirming the passage applied to himself. Jesus' rejection of Satan's application suggests he did not view this psalm as specifically messianic.
3. **Long Life Promise**: The psalm explicitly promises, "**With long life I will satisfy him** and show him my salvation" (Psalm 91:16). Jesus lived approximately 33 years, which was not considered a long life in ancient times when people regularly lived 70-80 years (Psalm 90:10). His life was cut short by crucifixion.
4. **Protection from Harm**: The psalm repeatedly promises deliverance from snares, pestilence, arrows, terror, and destruction, stating "no evil shall be allowed to befall you" and "I will deliver him; I will protect him; I will rescue him and honor him." Yet Jesus was arrested, beaten, mocked, and crucified—the opposite of protection from evil.
5. **Wicked Fall**: The psalm promises that "**a thousand may fall at your side**, and **ten thousand at your right hand**; But it **shall not come near you**" but Jesus was not delivered from the wicked at his crucifixion. His enemies did not "fall" and they did "come near" Jesus. 
6. **With long life I will satisfy him**: Most scholars agree Jesus only lived until 33 of age. That is in general not considered a long life and he was not receive "salvation" to be satisfied "with along life".
7. **Salvation for the Subject**: The psalm promises to "show him my salvation", but Jesus is the Savior who provides salvation for others, not the other way around.
8. **Testing God vs. Fulfilling Prophecy**: If this passage were a specific prophecy about the Messiah, intentionally jumping would be an act of fulfilling God's word, not testing Him. A prophecy is a prediction of what *will* happen; obeying it is faithfulness. However, Jesus refused to jump, identifying the act as "testing God" (Matthew 4:7). This distinction is crucial: Jesus treated the verse as a general promise of protection for the faithful (one that relies on God's sovereignty and cannot be forced or manipulated) rather than a specific script or mechanical guarantee for the Messiah.

### Critical

Critical scholars view Psalm 91 as a psalm of trust and protection addressed to any believer, not a messianic prophecy. The psalm uses general conditional language ("he who dwells," "you will not fear") applicable to any faithful person. The promises of long life, protection from harm, and being shown salvation are incompatible with Jesus' historical experience. Jesus' rejection of Satan's application during the temptation further undermines claims of messianic fulfillment.

## Conclusion

Psalm 91 is a psalm offering encouragement to anyone who trusts in God, promising divine protection and long life to the faithful. The psalm's universal language, Jesus' explicit rejection of its application during Satan's temptation, and the contradiction between its promises (long life, protection from harm, being shown salvation) and Jesus' actual experience (brief life, crucifixion, being the Savior rather than needing salvation) demonstrate this passage was not a messianic prophecy. The passage must be taken out of its literary and contextual framework to apply it to Jesus. No Old Testament or New Testament author explicitly identifies this psalm as messianic prophecy.
