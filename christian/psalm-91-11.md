# Angels Will Guard You in All Your Ways

Psalm 91 is one of the most beloved passages in the Bible, often recited for comfort and protection. However, its interpretation becomes complex when applied to the life of Jesus. While some see it as a direct prophecy about the Messiah, others find significant contradictions between its promises and Jesus' actual experiences. What does this psalm truly promise, and how does it relate to the figure of the Messiah?

## The Divine Promises of Protection in Psalm 91

The psalmist uses vivid imagery to describe God's care. Terms like the "snare of the fowler" refer to a hunter's trap, while "pestilence" denotes a deadly disease. God is said to cover the faithful with his "pinions," which are feathers or wings. His faithfulness is compared to a "shield and buckler," with a buckler being a small shield. The "adder" mentioned later is a venomous snake. These metaphors emphasize a total and encompassing security.

> He who dwells in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty. I will say to the LORD, "My refuge and my fortress, my God, in whom I trust." For he will deliver you from the snare of the fowler and from the deadly pestilence. He will cover you with his pinions, and under his wings you will find refuge; his faithfulness is a shield and buckler. You will not fear the terror of the night, nor the arrow that flies by day, nor the pestilence that stalks in darkness, nor the destruction that wastes at noonday... Because you have made the LORD your dwelling place—the Most High, who is my refuge—no evil shall be allowed to befall you, no plague come near your tent. **For he will command his angels concerning you to guard you in all your ways. On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.** You will tread on the lion and the adder; the young lion and the serpent you will trample underfoot. "Because he holds fast to me in love, I will deliver him; I will protect him, because he knows my name. When he calls to me, I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble; I will rescue him and honor him. **With long life I will satisfy him and show him my salvation.**" — Psalm 91:1-16 (ESV)

## Perspectives on Messianic Fulfillment

### The Wilderness Temptation of Jesus

Satan quoted this psalm when tempting Jesus in the wilderness:

> Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, **'He will command his angels concerning you,' and 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.'**" Jesus said to him, "Again it is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.'" — Matthew 4:5-7 (ESV)

### Traditional Christian Interpretations

Some Christians interpret this passage as messianic prophecy. A messianic prophecy is a prediction about a future savior. They argue that:

- Satan recognized this psalm referred to the Messiah
- God provided supernatural angelic protection for Jesus
- Jesus demonstrated authority over evil by trampling serpents and lions

However, several factors challenge this interpretation:

#### Universal Application

The psalm opens with conditional language addressing anyone who trusts God: "**He who dwells** in the shelter of the Most High will abide in the shadow of the Almighty." This is a general promise for any believer. It is not exclusively for the Messiah.

#### Jesus' Response

When Satan quoted this psalm, Jesus rebuked him for testing God. He quoted Deuteronomy 6:16 in response. He did not affirm the passage applied to himself. Jesus' rejection of Satan's application suggests he did not view this psalm as specifically messianic.

#### Testing God vs. Fulfilling Prophecy

If this passage were a specific prophecy about the Messiah, intentionally jumping would be an act of fulfilling God's word, not testing Him. A prophecy is a prediction of what *will* happen; obeying it is faithfulness. However, Jesus refused to jump, identifying the act as "testing God" (Matthew 4:7). This distinction is crucial: Jesus treated the verse as a general promise of protection for the faithful (one that relies on God's sovereignty and cannot be forced or manipulated) rather than a specific script or mechanical guarantee for the Messiah.

#### Long Life Promise

The psalm explicitly promises, "**With long life I will satisfy him** and show him my salvation" (Psalm 91:16). Jesus lived approximately 33 years. This was not considered a long life in ancient times. People regularly lived 70 to 80 years according to Psalm 90:10. His life was cut short by crucifixion.

#### Protection from Harm

The psalm repeatedly promises deliverance from snares, pestilence, arrows, terror, and destruction. It states "no evil shall be allowed to befall you." It also says "I will deliver him; I will protect him; I will rescue him and honor him." Yet Jesus was arrested, beaten, mocked, and crucified. This was the opposite of protection from evil.

#### Wicked Fall

The psalm promises that "**a thousand may fall at your side**, and **ten thousand at your right hand**; But it **shall not come near you**" (Psalm 91:7). However, Jesus was not delivered from the wicked at his crucifixion. His enemies did not "fall," and they certainly "came near" him.

#### Salvation for the Subject

The psalm promises to "show him my salvation." Jesus is the Savior who provides salvation for others. He is not one who needs to receive it for himself.

#### Literary Genre

Psalm 91 is often classified as a [psalm of trust](https://enduringword.com/bible-commentary/psalm-91/). It offers encouragement to all believers who trust God. Like other wisdom psalms, it presents an idealized picture of divine protection. This is meant to encourage faith. It does not guarantee absolute immunity from suffering. History demonstrates many faithful people suffered. Job, the prophets, and martyrs are clear examples.

#### Satan's Use as Evidence

If this psalm were clearly and exclusively messianic, Satan's temptation would be nonsensical. Satan was testing whether Jesus would presume upon God's protection. The fact this was presented as a test indicates the psalm was understood as a general promise. Satan attempted to get Jesus to misapply it.

### Critical Scholarly Perspectives

Critical scholars view Psalm 91 as a psalm of trust and protection addressed to any believer. They do not see it as a messianic prophecy. The psalm uses general conditional language applicable to any faithful person. The promises of long life, protection from harm, and being shown salvation are incompatible with Jesus' historical experience. Jesus' rejection of Satan's application during the temptation further undermines claims of messianic fulfillment.

## Scholarly Criticisms and Defenses

Some scholars argue that "long life" is satisfied by Jesus' eternal life or resurrection. However, the psalm's context refers to earthly longevity and protection from physical death. This is seen in the contrast with the "thousand falling at your side." Interpreting it as eternal life requires a spiritualized reading that departs from the plain meaning of the wisdom tradition.

Others suggest that Jesus' suffering was a temporary "snare" and his ultimate victory fulfills the protection. Yet the psalm says "no evil shall be allowed to befall you." It implies a shield against the experience of suffering itself. It is not just an ultimate rescue after suffering.

## Conclusion

Psalm 91 provides powerful encouragement for those who trust in God. Its application to Jesus as a messianic prophecy faces several challenges:

- [The psalm uses universal language applicable to all believers.](#universal-application)
- [Jesus' response to Satan suggests he did not view the psalm as a specific messianic mandate.](#jesus-response)
- [Jesus' distinction between testing God and fulfilling prophecy highlights the verse as a general promise.](#testing-god-vs-fulfilling-prophecy)
- [The promise of a long life contrasts with Jesus' relatively short life and crucifixion.](#long-life-promise)
- [The protection from all evil promised in the psalm differs from Jesus' suffering and death.](#protection-from-harm)
- [The promise that enemies will fall while the subject remains untouched was not realized in Jesus' passion.](#wicked-fall)
- [Psalm 91 is better understood as a psalm of trust rather than a specific messianic prophecy.](#literary-genre)
