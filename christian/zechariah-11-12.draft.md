# Thirty Pieces of Silver

## The Prophecy

> Then I said to them, "If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them." And **they weighed out as my wages thirty pieces of silver**. Then the LORD said to me, "Throw it to the potter"—the lordly price at which I was priced by them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the LORD, to the potter. — Zechariah 11:12-13 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

> Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests and said, "What will you give me if I deliver him over to you?" And **they paid him thirty pieces of silver**. And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him. — Matthew 26:14-16 (ESV)

After Jesus' arrest and condemnation, Judas returned the money:

> Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he changed his mind and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." They said, "What is that to us? See to it yourself." And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself. But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money." So they took counsel and bought with them the potter's field as a burial place for strangers. — Matthew 27:3-7 (ESV)

### Christian

Christians interpret this passage as messianic prophecy, arguing that:

**Precise Detail:** The specific amount—thirty pieces of silver—is remarkably precise to be coincidental. This was not a common sum but the contemptuous price of a slave according to the Law (Exodus 21:32: "If the ox gores a slave, male or female, the owner shall give to their master thirty shekels of silver"). This specific valuation demonstrates how cheaply Jesus was valued.

**Connection to the Potter:** Zechariah 11:13 instructs throwing the silver "to the potter" in "the house of the LORD," which Matthew sees fulfilled when the chief priests used Judas's returned silver to purchase the potter's field (Matthew 27:7-10). Matthew explicitly connects this to prophecy, though he attributes it to Jeremiah rather than Zechariah (likely referring to Jeremiah's visit to the potter in Jeremiah 18-19).

**Type and Antitype Pattern:** Zechariah's symbolic action, in which God's prophet received contemptuous payment for his shepherding work, foreshadowed Jesus' betrayal. Just as God's care of Israel through His prophet was valued at a slave's price, so God's Son was valued at the same contemptuous amount.

**Matthew's Recognition:** Matthew records the exact fulfillment of the amount and later explicitly connects the events to prophecy when describing what happened to the money (Matthew 27:9-10).

However, several contextual factors complicate this interpretation:

1. **Symbolic Prophetic Drama**: [Zechariah 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zechariah_11) presents a symbolic action where Zechariah acts out God's relationship with Israel using shepherd imagery. The "thirty pieces of silver" represents the contemptuous payment Zechariah receives for his work as shepherd, symbolizing how little Israel valued God's care. This is prophetic theater conveying God's message to Zechariah's contemporaries.

2. **Historical Context**: [The passage describes events in Zechariah's own time](https://www.ncesc.com/is-zechariah-1112-13-a-messianic-prophecy/) or immediate future within the post-exilic period, not events 500+ years later. The breaking of the staffs "Favor" and "Union" (Zechariah 11:10,14) symbolizes God's broken covenant with the people and the division between Judah and Israel—historical realities of Zechariah's era.

3. **No Messianic Markers**: The passage contains no reference to the Messiah, a Davidic king, salvation, or redemption. The context focuses entirely on God's judgment upon Israel for rejecting His shepherding care. The shepherd imagery represents God or God's prophet, not specifically the future Messiah.

4. **Matthew's Attribution Issue**: When Matthew quotes this prophecy in Matthew 27:9-10, he attributes it to "Jeremiah the prophet" rather than Zechariah. This raises questions about the precise nature of the prophetic connection Matthew intended.

### Jews

**Not considered messianic.** Jewish scholars view Zechariah 11 as symbolic prophetic action communicating God's message to post-exilic Israel. The shepherd imagery, wages, and potter reference all function as prophetic symbolism about Israel's rejection of God's care and the resulting judgment. The passage addresses Zechariah's contemporary situation, not messianic prophecy. The thirty pieces of silver was a common sum (the value of a slave) and its coincidental match with Judas's payment does not establish prophetic fulfillment, as silver was standard currency for various transactions.

## Conclusion

**Debatable fulfillment.** The exact match of thirty pieces of silver—the contemptuous price of a slave—between Zechariah 11:12 and Judas's betrayal payment is a precise detail. Additionally, the connection to the potter and the house of the LORD finds correspondence in the chief priests' purchase of the potter's field with the returned blood money. Matthew explicitly saw prophetic significance in these events. However, Zechariah 11 functions primarily as symbolic prophetic drama about Israel's rejection of God's shepherding in the post-exilic period, with no explicit messianic markers in the original context. The passage uses shepherd imagery to depict God or God's prophet, not specifically the Messiah. Whether this represents intentional prophetic foreshadowing of Jesus' betrayal or coincidental correspondence of details depends on one's interpretive framework. The precise amount and the potter connection provide specific points of correspondence, but the original context lacks clear messianic indicators. Jewish scholars do not recognize this as messianic prophecy.
