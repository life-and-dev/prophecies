# Throw It to the Potter

## The Prophecy

> Then I said to them, "If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them." And they weighed out as my wages thirty pieces of silver. Then the LORD said to me, **"Throw it to the potter"**—the lordly price at which I was priced by them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and **threw them into the house of the LORD, to the potter**. — Zechariah 11:12-13 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

> Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he changed his mind and **brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders**, saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." They said, "What is that to us? See to it yourself." And **throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple**, he departed, and he went and hanged himself. But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money." So they took counsel and **bought with them the potter's field** as a burial place for strangers. Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, "And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me." — Matthew 27:3-10 (ESV)

### Christian

Christians believe this prophecy was fulfilled in the events following Judas's betrayal, arguing that:

**Sequence of Specific Details**: The prophecy contains multiple specific details that match in exact sequence:
1. Thirty pieces of silver (the exact amount)
2. Thrown into the house of the LORD (the temple)
3. Connected to the potter (potter's field)

This precise sequence—amount, location, and use—is too specific to dismiss as coincidence.

**Matthew's Explicit Citation**: Matthew explicitly states "Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet" and quotes the prophecy, though attributing it to Jeremiah rather than Zechariah (Matthew 27:9-10). This attribution issue is debated, but Matthew clearly saw prophetic significance in these events.

**Beyond Human Control**: Zechariah wrote approximately 500 years before Jesus. He could not have fabricated this based on later events. The specific combination of details—thirty silver, temple, potter—demonstrates prophetic foresight.

**Ironic Fulfillment**: The "lordly price" (sarcastically referring to the contemptuous valuation) finds its ultimate fulfillment when the religious leaders valued Jesus, God's Son, at the price of a slave.

However, whether Zechariah 11:13 was originally messianic prophecy is disputed:

### Jews

Jewish scholars view Zechariah 11:12-13 as part of prophetic symbolic action addressing Zechariah's own time, not messianic prophecy. (See the analysis in the related prophecy about thirty pieces of silver.)

**Symbolic Prophetic Drama**: Zechariah 11 presents symbolic actions where Zechariah acts out God's relationship with Israel. The thirty pieces of silver represents the contemptuous payment for his work as shepherd, symbolizing how little Israel valued God's care. Throwing it "to the potter" in "the house of the LORD" was part of this symbolic drama, likely enacted in Zechariah's own time.

**Historical Context**: The passage addresses the post-exilic period and God's judgment on Israel for rejecting His shepherding care. This is not about events 500 years in the future but about Zechariah's contemporary situation.

**Potter Reference Unclear**: The exact meaning of "throw it to the potter" in the original context is debated even among scholars. It may refer to a potter working at the temple, temple treasury ("potter" as a textual variant), or symbolic language about worthlessness. The connection to a literal potter's field purchase may not have been the original intent.

**Matthew's Attribution Problem**: Matthew attributes the quotation to "Jeremiah" (Matthew 27:9) rather than Zechariah, raising questions about the precise nature of the prophetic connection Matthew intended. Some suggest Matthew conflated multiple prophecies or referenced a collection of prophetic writings associated with Jeremiah.

### Critical

Critical scholars view Zechariah 11:12-13 as symbolic prophetic action within Zechariah's ministry to post-exilic Israel. The shepherd imagery, contemptuous wage, and throwing the silver represent God's message about Israel's rejection. The Gospel writers, particularly Matthew, saw connections between Judas's actions and Zechariah's symbolic drama, interpreting the events through a prophetic lens. The attribution to Jeremiah in Matthew 27:9 (instead of Zechariah) complicates the analysis. Whether this represents actual prophetic fulfillment or the Gospel writers finding meaningful patterns in earlier Scripture depends on one's interpretive framework.

## Conclusion

**Debatable fulfillment.** The sequence of specific details is remarkable: thirty pieces of silver thrown into the house of the LORD (temple) and connected to the potter (potter's field purchase). Matthew explicitly cites this as prophetic fulfillment (Matthew 27:9-10), though attributing it to Jeremiah rather than Zechariah raises interpretive questions. The specific combination of details—exact amount, location (temple), and use (potter/potter's field)—represents a precise correspondence that Zechariah wrote approximately 500 years before the events. However, Zechariah 11:12-13 functions as symbolic prophetic action addressing Zechariah's own time, with the shepherd imagery representing God's relationship with post-exilic Israel. The exact meaning of "throw it to the potter" in the original context is debated. Jewish scholars view this as enacted prophetic symbolism in Zechariah's era, not messianic prophecy about distant future events. No Old Testament author identifies this as messianic prophecy. The interpretation depends on whether Zechariah's symbolic actions can carry both immediate meaning (for his audience) and ultimate prophetic fulfillment (in Jesus' betrayal), and how to understand Matthew's attribution to Jeremiah instead of Zechariah.
