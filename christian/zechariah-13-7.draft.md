# Strike the Shepherd, Scatter the Sheep

## The Prophecy

> "Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, against the man who stands next to me," declares the LORD of hosts. **"Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered**; I will turn my hand against the little ones." In the whole land, declares the LORD, two thirds shall be cut off and perish, and one third shall be left alive. And I will put this third into the fire, and refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested. They will call upon my name, and I will answer them. I will say, "They are my people"; and they will say, "The LORD is my God." — Zechariah 13:7-9 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

Jesus quoted this prophecy before His arrest:

> And Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away, for it is written, **'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'"** But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee. — Mark 14:27-28 (ESV)

> Then Jesus said to them, "You will all fall away because of me this night. For it is written, **'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'"** But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee. — Matthew 26:31-32 (ESV)

And it happened exactly as Jesus predicted:

> Then all the disciples **left him and fled**. — Matthew 26:56 (ESV)

> And they all left him and fled. — Mark 14:50 (ESV)

Even Peter, who had boldly declared he would never deny Jesus, scattered with the others and later denied knowing Him three times (Matthew 26:69-75).

### Christian

Christians believe Jesus fulfilled this prophecy, arguing that:

**Jesus' Self-Application**: Jesus explicitly applied this passage to Himself (Mark 14:27; Matthew 26:31), identifying Himself as the shepherd who would be struck. His authority to interpret prophecy and apply it to His own situation is significant.

**Precise Fulfillment**: The disciples did scatter exactly as Jesus predicted when He was arrested. All abandoned Him at His arrest (Matthew 26:56; Mark 14:50), and even Peter denied knowing Him three times. The scattering was literal and documented by multiple Gospel writers.

**Divine Plan**: The phrase "I will strike the shepherd" indicates God's sovereign plan. This aligns with the suffering servant pattern in Isaiah 53:10: "Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him; he has put him to grief." God striking the shepherd does not contradict Jesus being the Messiah but demonstrates the atoning work accomplished through His suffering and death.

**Restoration Promised**: Jesus immediately followed His citation of Zechariah 13:7 with a promise of restoration: "But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee" (Mark 14:28; Matthew 26:32). The scattering was temporary, and Jesus would regather His disciples after resurrection.

However, whether Zechariah 13:7 was originally messianic is disputed:

### Jews

**Not considered messianic.** Jewish scholars raise several objections:

1. **Context of False Prophets**: Zechariah 13 begins by discussing the removal of false prophets from the land: "On that day there shall be a fountain opened for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and uncleanness. And on that day, declares the LORD of hosts, I will cut off the names of the idols from the land... And also I will remove from the land the prophets and the spirit of uncleanness" (Zechariah 13:1-2). Verse 7's "sword against my shepherd" refers to God's judgment on Israel's unfaithful leaders and false prophets, not the righteous Messiah.

2. **God Striking His Shepherd**: The phrase "Strike the shepherd" depicts divine judgment against someone. Jewish scholars argue God would not strike the Messiah, who is supposed to be righteous, victorious, and bring redemption to Israel. The shepherd being struck represents God's judgment on unfaithful leaders who misled the people.

3. **Scattered Sheep Represents Israel's Judgment**: The scattering describes Israel going into exile or experiencing national dispersion as judgment for following false shepherds. This happened historically in 586 BC (Babylonian exile) and 70 AD (Roman destruction and diaspora). The scattered sheep represent the nation of Israel, not twelve disciples.

4. **Following Verses Describe National Judgment**: Zechariah 13:8-9 describes "two thirds shall be cut off and perish, and one third shall be left alive" who will be refined "as one refines silver." This clearly depicts national calamity affecting the entire population of Israel, not twelve disciples scattering temporarily at Jesus' arrest. The scale and context indicate a larger historical event, not the disciples' brief abandonment of Jesus.

5. **The Shepherd is Called "My Shepherd"**: God calls him "my shepherd" and "the man who stands next to me," suggesting a leader appointed by God to care for Israel. When that leader proves unfaithful or fails, God brings judgment, and the people scatter. This pattern occurred multiple times in Israel's history with unfaithful kings and leaders.

### Critical

Critical scholars view Zechariah 13:7 within its immediate context of judgment on false prophets and unfaithful leaders. The passage describes God's judgment on a shepherd who failed to properly lead God's people, resulting in national scattering and judgment (two-thirds perishing, one-third refined through suffering). The original context addresses Israel's historical experience of exile and judgment, not messianic prophecy. Jesus applied the verse to His situation, using scriptural language to interpret His impending arrest, but this represents his interpretation rather than the passage's original prophetic intent.

## Conclusion

**Debatable fulfillment.** Jesus explicitly quoted Zechariah 13:7 and applied it to Himself, predicting His disciples would scatter when He was struck down. The disciples did abandon Him exactly as He predicted when He was arrested—all fled (Matthew 26:56; Mark 14:50), and Peter denied knowing Him. Jesus' self-application and the literal fulfillment of disciples scattering are documented by multiple Gospel writers. However, whether Zechariah 13:7 was originally messianic prophecy is disputed. The immediate context addresses false prophets and unfaithful shepherds facing God's judgment, and the following verses (Zechariah 13:8-9) describe national-scale judgment with two-thirds of the population perishing and one-third being refined—a scope that far exceeds twelve disciples temporarily scattering. Jewish scholars view the passage as addressing God's judgment on Israel's unfaithful leaders throughout history, resulting in national exile and dispersion. No Old Testament author identifies this as messianic prophecy. The passage can be read either as original messianic prophecy or as Jesus using existing scriptural language to interpret and predict His own situation. The literal fulfillment of disciples scattering is undeniable; the original prophetic intent is debated.
