# Prophecies of God

Prophecy is God's way of proving His sovereignty over time itself. When predictions made thousands of years ago come to pass with remarkable precision, they demonstrate that the Bible is not merely human wisdom, but divine revelation. For believers today, prophecy serves multiple vital purposes: it strengthens faith by showing God's faithfulness, provides assurance about the future, validates Scripture's authority, and reveals God's redemptive plan throughout history.

In our skeptical age, fulfilled prophecy offers objective evidence that transcends subjective spiritual experiences. It addresses fundamental questions: Is the Bible trustworthy? Is Jesus truly the promised Messiah? What can we expect in the future? By examining prophecies through the lens of history, ancient texts, and apostolic testimony, we can make informed decisions about matters of eternal significance.

## Categories of Biblical Prophecy

The prophecies documented here are organized into five distinct categories, each serving a unique purpose in understanding God's revelation:

### [Messianic Prophecies](messianic.md)

These are prophecies that **both Jews and Christians** recognize as referring to the Messiah or Christ. They establish the criteria for identifying the promised deliverer and describe what to expect from him. These prophecies are foundational because they provide the clearest blueprint for recognizing God's anointed one when he comes.

### [Christian Prophecies](christian.md)

These prophecies are understood by Christians to refer to Jesus as the Messiah (Christ), but **Jewish scholars typically do not** interpret them as messianic. Instead, they often attribute these passages to the nation of Israel, other historical figures, or future events unrelated to the Christian understanding of the Christ. This category examines the interpretative divide and presents evidence for why Christians believe these prophecies point to Jesus.

### [Trinitarian Prophecies](trinitarian.md)

This category focuses on prophecies that foretold the Messiah would be **God Almighty Himself**, supporting the doctrine of the Trinity. These passages indicate that the coming deliverer would be not merely a human king or prophet, but divine in nature—a crucial distinction in Christian theology that sets Jesus apart from all other messianic claimants.

### [Political Prophecies](political.md)

These prophecies originally warned ancient audiences or provided hope during troubled times, but for modern readers they serve as **scientific evidence** of Scripture's divine inspiration. When prophecies about historical nations, cities, and events came true exactly as foretold—often against all odds—they validate the supernatural origin of the biblical text.

### [End Times Prophecies](end-times.md)

These prophecies concern **future events** at the end of history, often called the "Last Days," the "Second Coming of Jesus," or the "Final Judgment." They reveal God's ultimate plan for humanity and creation, providing hope and warning in equal measure. While unfulfilled, they demonstrate what God has promised will come to pass.

Each prophecy is evaluated according to three perspectives: **Historians** (secular historical evidence), **Tanakh** (Old Testament testimony), and **Apostles** (New Testament witness). This multi-perspective approach allows for honest examination of both the strengths and challenges of prophetic interpretation.
