# Fulfilled Prophecies about Jesus

- To Christians, he is the Christ, [the Son of God](https://son.ofgod.info), the savior of the world
- To Muslims, he is a revered prophet, born of a virgin, but not God's Son
- To Jews, he was a teacher who didn't fulfill messianic prophecies
- To secularists, he was perhaps a wise moral teacher, but nothing more

According to the Bible, God made several promises about the Christ.

If Jesus is the Christ, it changes everything. How we understand God, ourselves, history, and our eternal destiny.

Luke, who gathered many witness accounts, recorded:

> Beginning with **Moses and all the Prophets**, he *(Jesus)* interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. — Luke 24:27 (ESV)

The Old Testament was completed ~400 BC (Malachi). The **Dead Sea Scrolls** (discovered 1947) contain complete copies of Isaiah and other prophetic books dating to ~200 BC—**before Jesus was born**.

No one can claim the prophecies were written after the fact. They're documented in manuscripts predating Jesus by centuries.

Jesus claimed that the Old Testament Scriptures testified about him. The question is: *Do they?*
