# Fulfilled Prophecies about Jesus

- To Christians, he is the Christ, [the Son of God](https://son.ofgod.info), the savior of the world
- To Muslims, he is a revered prophet, born of a virgin, but not God's Son
- To Jews, he was a teacher who didn't fulfill messianic prophecies
- To secularists, he was perhaps a wise moral teacher, but nothing more

According to the Bible, God made several promises about the Christ.

If Jesus is the Christ, it changes everything. How we understand God, ourselves, history, and our eternal destiny.

Luke, who gathered many witness accounts, recorded:

> Beginning with **Moses and all the Prophets**, he *(Jesus)* interpreted to them in all the Scriptures the things concerning himself. — Luke 24:27 (ESV)

The Old Testament was completed ~400 BC (Malachi). The **Dead Sea Scrolls** (discovered 1947) contain complete copies of Isaiah and other prophetic books dating to ~200 BC—**before Jesus was born**.

No one can claim the prophecies were written after the fact. They're documented in manuscripts predating Jesus by centuries.

Jesus claimed that the Old Testament Scriptures testified about him. The question is: *Do they?*

Not all prophecies are equally clear or compelling. To help you focus on the strongest evidence, each prophecy is categorized by fulfillment strength:

**Complete Fulfillment (13 prophecies)** - Christians present strong evidence that Jesus fulfilled the entire prophecy as originally described. These prophecies contain specific, verifiable details that match historical records of Jesus' life.

**Vague or Debatable (23 prophecies)** - Jesus could have fulfilled these prophecies, but they are either so general that they could apply to others, or the original context makes it unclear whether they are messianic predictions at all. These rely heavily on interpretation rather than specific details. The individual prophecy files conclude with "Possibly" or "Debatable" as their strength of fulfillment.

**Partially Fulfilled (1 prophecy)** - Only part of the prophecy has been fulfilled according to the original text. Christians argue the remaining portions will be fulfilled at Jesus' second coming due to the dual-nature of messianic prophecy (suffering servant at first coming, conquering king at second coming). Jews argue a true Messiah should fulfill all prophecies in one lifetime.

**Misunderstood Context (3 prophecies)** - The original text clearly refers to something else (Israel's history, David's life, etc.), but Christians apply them to Jesus through typological interpretation—seeing Jesus as fulfilling a pattern, not a direct prediction. Jews reject this interpretive method.

## Partially Fulfilled

These prophecies have elements fulfilled in Jesus' first coming, but significant portions await future fulfillment according to the original prophecy text. Christians argue the unfulfilled portions will be accomplished at Jesus' second coming; Jews argue this indicates non-fulfillment since a true Messiah should fulfill all prophecies in one lifetime.

## Misunderstood Context

These passages clearly refer to Israel's history or other subjects in their original context. Christians apply them to Jesus through typological interpretation—arguing Jesus fulfills a pattern rather than a direct prediction. Jews reject this method as reading meaning into the text.
