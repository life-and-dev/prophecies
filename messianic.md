# Messianic Prophecies

Both Jews and Christians believe these prophecies refer to [the Messiah or Christ](https://kingdom.ofgod.info/christ).

Christians belief that Jesus fulfilled the Messianic prophecies as Peter publically defended Jesus by providing the 3 proofs that Jesus is the Christ:

> “Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, [a man](https://son.ofgod.info/nature):
> 1. attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, 
> 2. as you yourselves know — this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God:
>    - you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. For David says concerning him,
>
>> ‘I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken; therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; my flesh also will dwell in hope. For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or [let your Holy One see corruption](messianic/psalm-16-10.md). You have made known to me the paths of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence.’ — Psalm 16:8-11
>
> Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. 
> 3. Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says,  
>> ‘[The LORD said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.](messianic/psalm-110-1.md)” — Psalm 110:1
>
> Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”
>
> — Acts 2:22-36 (ESV)

Messianic prophecies are significant because it indicate how to identify the real Messiah and what to expect from the Messiah.
