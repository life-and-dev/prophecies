# Ascended to God's Right Hand

> **Fulfillment Category:** Complete Fulfillment
>
> This prophecy contains specific, verifiable details that were demonstrably fulfilled in Jesus' documented life. The evidence includes multiple eyewitness testimony of Jesus' ascension to heaven in Jerusalem, with Stephen later seeing him "standing at the right hand of God" shortly before his martyrdom.

## The Prophecy

As noted in the "Lord at God's Right Hand" prophecy, Psalm 110:1 prophesied:

> The LORD says to my Lord: **"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool."**

## Fulfillment in Jesus

> So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, **was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God**. — Mark 16:19 (ESV)

Peter testified:

> Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, **"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.'"** — Acts 2:33-35 (ESV)

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Ascension witnessed** (Acts 1:9-11): Disciples saw Jesus ascend
- **Session at God's right hand** (Mark 16:19; Acts 2:33; Ephesians 1:20): Jesus seated at God's right hand
- **Peter's testimony** (Acts 2:33-35): Applies Psalm 110:1 to Jesus
- **Current position** (Hebrews 1:3; 10:12; Colossians 3:1): Jesus currently seated there
- **Intercession** (Romans 8:34): Christ intercedes at God's right hand

## Jewish Perspective

*(See "The Lord at God's Right Hand" prophecy for detailed Jewish perspective and objections)*

**Summary**: Jews debate whether Psalm 110 is messianic. Some interpretations suggest David speaking about himself or Abraham. Objections include the military/political context and the Melchizedek priesthood issue.

## Christian Perspective

### Response

**Multiple witnesses**: The ascension was witnessed by the apostles (Acts 1:9-11). Peter's Pentecost sermon, preached to thousands including hostile religious leaders, boldly proclaimed Jesus' ascension and session at God's right hand.

**Present reality**: Unlike other prophecies awaiting future fulfillment, this is currently true—Jesus is now seated at God's right hand, interceding for believers and reigning until all enemies are subdued.

**Apostolic consensus**: Multiple New Testament authors independently testify to Jesus' exaltation to God's right hand (Mark, Luke/Acts, Paul, author of Hebrews, Peter).

## Assessment

**Christian View**: Jesus ascended to heaven and is currently seated at God's right hand, fulfilling Psalm 110:1. He reigns there until all enemies are made his footstool.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Yes. Multiple eyewitnesses testified to the ascension. The early church's consistent testimony about Jesus' session at God's right hand, preached publicly in Jerusalem shortly after crucifixion, demonstrates this was believed from the beginning. While the complete subjugation of enemies awaits fulfillment, the ascension and session are affirmed by multiple independent sources.
