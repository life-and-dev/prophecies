# The Beloved Servant of God

## The Prophecy

Isaiah depicted the Messiah's demeanor:

> Behold **My servant**, whom I uphold, My chosen, **in whom My soul delights**; I have put **My Spirit upon him**; he will bring forth justice to the nations.
>
> He will not cry aloud or lift up his voice, or make it heard in the street; a bruised reed he will not break, and a faintly burning wick he will not quench; he will faithfully bring forth justice. He will not grow faint or be discouraged till he has established justice in the earth; and the coastlands wait for his law.
>
> — Isaiah 42:1-4 (ESV)

A gentle, Spirit-empowered servant who brings justice to the nations without violence or fanfare.

## Fulfillment in Jesus

Matthew records Jesus' gentle approach:

> But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew from there. And great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all. Yet he warned them not to make him known, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet, saying:
>
>> Behold! **My servant** whom I have chosen, **My beloved in whom My soul is well pleased**! I will **put My Spirit upon him**, and he will declare justice to the Gentiles. He will not quarrel nor cry out, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets. A bruised reed he will not break, and smoking flax he will not quench, till he sends forth justice to victory; and in his name Gentiles will trust...
>
> — Matthew 12:15-21 (NKJV)

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Servant role** (Matthew 12:18; Philippians 2:7-8): Jesus served God
- **God's declaration** (Matthew 3:17; 17:5): God personally declared Jesus "My beloved in whom My soul is well pleased"
- **Spirit-empowerment** (Matthew 3:16; John 1:32-33): God put His Spirit upon Jesus at baptism
- **Gentle ministry** (Matthew 12:19-20): Did not quarrel; gentle with the broken
- **Justice to Gentiles** (Matthew 12:18, 21): Ministry extended to all nations

## Jewish Perspective

### Messianic Status

**Debated Whether Messianic.** Isaiah 42:1-4 is part of the "Servant Songs" in Isaiah, which Jews interpret in multiple ways.

### Jewish Objections

1. **Israel as servant**: The predominant Jewish interpretation identifies the "servant" as the nation of Israel collectively (see Isaiah 41:8-9; 44:1-2, 21; 45:4; 49:3 where Israel is explicitly called "my servant"), not an individual Messiah.

2. **The prophet Isaiah**: Some see this as Isaiah describing his own mission to bring God's word to the people.

3. **Incomplete fulfillment**: Even if applied to Messiah, Jews argue Jesus didn't fulfill verse 4: "He will not grow faint or be discouraged till he has established justice in the earth; and the coastlands wait for his law"—justice was not established globally, and the world doesn't follow Jesus' teachings as law.

4. **Gentile focus problematic**: The passage emphasizes bringing justice to Gentiles, but Jews argue the Messiah's primary mission is restoring Israel first, then influencing the world through Israel's example (Isaiah 2:2-3).

## Christian Perspective

### Responses to Jewish Objections

#### 1. Individual Servant, Not Collective Israel

Christians respond that while Israel is called "servant" in some contexts (Isaiah 41:8-9; 44:1-2), the Servant Songs (Isaiah 42:1-4; 49:1-6; 50:4-9; 52:13-53:12) describe an individual who:

- **Brings Israel back to God** (Isaiah 49:5-6): The servant cannot be Israel bringing itself back to God, so must be distinct from the nation
- **Suffers for Israel's sins** (Isaiah 53:4-6, 8): "He was wounded for our transgressions... the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all"—Israel cannot vicariously suffer for its own sins
- **Is sinless** (Isaiah 53:9): "He had done no violence, nor was any deceit in his mouth"—this doesn't describe sinful Israel
- **Dies and rises** (Isaiah 53:8-10, 12): The servant is "cut off from the land of the living" yet "shall prolong his days"—describing resurrection, not national restoration

The shift from corporate "servant" (Isaiah 41-44) to individual "servant" (in the Servant Songs) indicates a specific person who represents and redeems Israel (Romans 9:6; Galatians 3:16, 29).

#### 2. Not Isaiah's Personal Mission

Christians argue Isaiah himself didn't fulfill the servant prophecies:

- **Isaiah wasn't given the Spirit** in the dramatic way described (Isaiah 42:1; 61:1; cf. Matthew 3:16)
- **Didn't bring justice to Gentiles globally** (Isaiah 42:1,4, 49:6): Isaiah's ministry was primarily to Judah
- **Didn't suffer vicariously** (Isaiah 53): Isaiah wasn't despised and rejected, didn't die for others' sins, wasn't buried with the rich
- **Didn't rise from death** (Isaiah 53:10-12): The servant's resurrection distinguishes this from any prophet's experience

#### 3. Two-Stage Fulfillment: Already and Not Yet

Christians acknowledge the tension in Isaiah 42:4 ("till he has established justice in the earth") but explain this through the concept of two comings:

- **First Coming (Past)**: Jesus established **spiritual justice** through his death and resurrection (Romans 3:21-26; 5:1)—justifying believers and inaugurating God's kingdom (Mark 1:15; Luke 17:20-21; Colossians 1:13)
- **Second Coming (Future)**: Jesus will establish **universal justice** when he returns (Matthew 25:31-46; Acts 17:31; Revelation 19:11-16)

The "already but not yet" nature of God's kingdom means Messiah can fulfill prophecies progressively: Isaiah 53 (suffering) fulfilled at first coming, Isaiah 42:4 (global justice) fulfilled at second coming. Jesus himself distinguished these stages (Luke 4:18-21 vs. Isaiah 61:2; Matthew 13:24-43).

#### 4. Gentile Inclusion Was Always God's Plan

Christians argue the Gentile focus isn't problematic because:

- **Abrahamic Covenant included all nations** (Genesis 12:3; 22:18): "In you all the families of the earth shall be blessed"
- **Isaiah repeatedly emphasizes Gentile salvation** (Isaiah 2:2-4; 42:1, 6; 49:6; 60:3): "I will make you as a light for the nations, that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth"
- **Messiah's mission encompasses both Israel and nations** (Isaiah 49:5-6): Restoring Israel AND being a light to Gentiles aren't contradictory but complementary
- **Jesus ministered to Israel first** (Matthew 10:5-6; 15:24; Romans 1:16): "Go nowhere among the Gentiles... but rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel"—before commissioning disciples to "make disciples of all nations" (Matthew 28:19)
- **Israel's restoration happens through Messiah's Gentile mission** (Romans 11:11-26): Gentile inclusion provokes Israel to jealousy, leading to national salvation: "all Israel will be saved" (Romans 11:26)

The pattern is Israel first, then Gentiles, then Israel's full restoration—all orchestrated by one Messiah in two stages (Acts 1:6-8; 3:19-21; 15:14-18).

#### 5. Isaiah Saw Christ's Glory

Christians point to apostolic testimony that Isaiah's visions were specifically about Christ. The apostle John explicitly states:

> Though he [Jesus] had done so many signs before them, they still did not believe in him, so that the word spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled:
>
>> "Lord, who has believed what he heard from us, and to whom has the arm of the LORD been revealed?" — Isaiah 53:1
>
> Therefore they could not believe. For again Isaiah said,
>
>> "He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, lest they see with their eyes, and understand with their heart, and turn, and I would heal them." — Isaiah 6:10
>
> Isaiah said these things because **he saw his glory and spoke of him**.
>
> — John 12:37-41 (ESV)

John declares that when Isaiah saw the Lord in the temple vision (Isaiah 6:1-5), he was actually seeing **Christ**. This is significant because:

- **Individual, Not Collective**: If Isaiah saw Christ's personal glory in Isaiah 6 (around 740 BC), then Isaiah's subsequent prophecies—including the Servant Songs in Isaiah 42-53—refer to this same individual Christ, not to Israel as a nation
- **Unified Interpretation**: John quotes both Isaiah 53:1 (the Suffering Servant passage) and Isaiah 6:10 (the temple vision), attributing both to Isaiah "seeing his [Christ's] glory"—demonstrating that the Servant prophecies concern the same divine figure Isaiah saw in the temple
- **Apostolic Authority**: This interpretation comes from John, an eyewitness apostle who walked with Jesus—his testimony that "Isaiah said these things because he saw his [Christ's] glory"

## Assessment

**Christian View**: Jesus is the beloved servant whom God chose, Spirit-empowered and gentle, bringing justice first spiritually and ultimately universally at his return. Matthew's explicit citation, God's public declarations, and apostolic testimony confirm fulfillment.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Yes. The evidence includes Matthew's direct citation as fulfilled prophecy, God's public declarations of pleasure in Jesus (heard by crowds at baptism and transfiguration), Spirit-empowerment witnessed at baptism, Jesus' gentle ministry approach, and John's apostolic testimony that Isaiah saw Christ's glory. The objections center on whether the servant is individual or collective, and whether justice must be immediately universal or can be progressive. The interpretation hinges on accepting the Servant Songs as distinct from corporate Israel passages, and allowing for two-stage fulfillment of global justice.
