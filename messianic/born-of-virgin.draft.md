# Born of a Virgin

> **Fulfillment Category:** Vague or Debatable
>
> This prophecy either lacks specific details or its original context makes messianic interpretation questionable. The interpretation hinges on whether "almah" means virgin, whether Isaiah 7:14 has messianic intent beyond its immediate context, and whether Matthew's apostolic authority validates connections not explicit in the original text.

## The Prophecy

Isaiah prophesied an extraordinary birth:

> Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, **the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel**. — Isaiah 7:14 (ESV)

This sign would be miraculous—a virgin conceiving and bearing a son whose name means "God with us."

## Fulfillment in Jesus

Mary conceived virginally through the Holy Spirit:

> When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together **she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit**. And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, "Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for **that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit**. She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins." All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: **"Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel"** (which means, God with us). — Matthew 1:18-23 (ESV)

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Matthew's explicit citation** (Matthew 1:22-23): Direct quotation of Isaiah 7:14 as fulfilled
- **Virgin conception** (Matthew 1:18): Mary found with child "from the Holy Spirit" before marital union
- **Angel's confirmation** (Matthew 1:20): Angel explicitly states conception is "from the Holy Spirit"
- **Immanuel meaning** (Matthew 1:23): "God with us"—signifying God's presence with humanity

Nobody called Jesus "Immanuel," yet Matthew considered Jesus' birth a fulfillment.

## Jewish Perspective

### Messianic Status

**Rejected as Messianic.** Isaiah 7:14 is one of the most disputed prophecies.

### Jewish Objections

1. **Translation dispute**: The Hebrew word "almah" (עַלְמָה) means "young woman," not necessarily "virgin"—the specific word for virgin is "betulah" (בְּתוּלָה). The Septuagint translated it as "parthenos" (virgin), but Jews argue this was an error or interpretive choice, not the text's plain meaning.

2. **Historical context**: Isaiah 7:14 was a sign given to King Ahaz about events in his own time (~735 BC), not 700 years in the future. The child is widely interpreted as King Hezekiah or Isaiah's own son (see Isaiah 8:3-4).

3. **Immediate fulfillment**: Isaiah 7:15-16 describes the child eating "curds and honey" and knowing good from evil before the two threatening kings are destroyed. This happened within a few years, not centuries later. The sign needed to be relevant to Ahaz's immediate crisis.

4. **Not a messianic passage**: Jews argue Isaiah 7 contains no messianic context. The chapter addresses the Syro-Ephraimite War (alliance between Syria and Northern Israel against Judah), not the Messiah. The virgin birth concept is seen as a later Christian reinterpretation of a text with an original, contemporary meaning.

5. **"Immanuel" not applied**: The name "Immanuel" means "God is with us"—referring to God's presence and help during Ahaz's crisis. No one ever called Jesus by this name, suggesting Matthew's application is symbolic, not literal fulfillment.

## Christian Perspective

### Responses to Jewish Objections

#### 1. Dual Fulfillment Pattern

Christians acknowledge the immediate historical context but argue the prophecy has both near and far fulfillment:

**Immediate sign**: A young woman (possibly Isaiah's wife or a woman in Ahaz's court) would bear a son as a sign to Ahaz. Before that child reached maturity, the threatening kings would be defeated (which happened).

**Ultimate fulfillment**: The language transcends the immediate situation, pointing to a greater future fulfillment in the virgin birth of Messiah. This dual-fulfillment pattern appears throughout Isaiah (e.g., Isaiah 9:1-2 refers to deliverance from Assyria but is applied to Jesus in Matthew 4:15-16).

#### 2. "Almah" Implies Virginity

**Word choice significant**: While "betulah" specifically means virgin, "almah" refers to a young woman of marriageable age, typically implying virginity in ancient Israelite culture. Every biblical usage of "almah" refers to an unmarried young woman.

**Septuagint authority**: The Septuagint (Greek translation of Hebrew Scriptures made by Jewish scholars ~250 BC, centuries before Christianity) rendered "almah" as "parthenos" (virgin). These Jewish translators understood virgin as the appropriate meaning.

**Sign requires miracle**: Isaiah says "the Lord himself will give you a sign"—something extraordinary. A young woman naturally conceiving would not constitute a miraculous sign. The miraculous nature requires virgin conception.

#### 3. Immanuel as Thematic Fulfillment

**Name meaning fulfilled**: While Jesus wasn't literally named "Immanuel," the meaning ("God with us") describes his identity and mission. Jesus embodies God's presence with humanity in the fullest sense.

**[Trinitarian](https://son.ofgod.info/trinity) view**: Trinitarian Christians understand that "God with us" means God incarnated into the baby Jesus—deity becoming human.

**Unitarian view**: Unitarian Christians understand that "God with us" means God was on their side, providing salvation by defeating death through Jesus' sacrifice and resurrection.

**Thematic names common**: In Hebrew culture, names often functioned thematically. John the Baptist wasn't called "Elijah," yet Jesus said he came "in the spirit and power of Elijah" (Luke 1:17; Matthew 11:14).

#### 4. Matthew's Apostolic Authority

**Inspired interpretation**: Matthew, writing under divine inspiration, had authority to reveal the prophecy's fuller meaning. The Holy Spirit revealed connections not apparent in the original historical context.

**Pattern in Matthew**: Matthew frequently shows how Jesus fulfills Old Testament prophecies in unexpected ways (Matthew 2:15 applies Hosea 11:1 "Out of Egypt I called my son" to Jesus, though Hosea referred to Israel).

**Jewish acceptance**: First-century Jewish audiences, familiar with their Scriptures, heard Matthew's Gospel. While many rejected Jesus, the argument itself was comprehensible within Jewish interpretive frameworks that recognized prophetic texts could have multiple layers of meaning.

## Assessment

**Christian View**: Jesus was miraculously born of a virgin, fulfilling Isaiah 7:14's ultimate meaning. The virgin birth serves as the sign of God's supernatural intervention in human history. The name "Immanuel" ("God with us") describes Jesus' identity as the presence of God incarnate or God's salvific presence among humanity.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Debatable. The interpretation hinges on several contested points: whether "almah" means virgin, whether Isaiah 7:14 has messianic intent beyond its immediate context, whether a name must be literally applied or can function thematically, and whether Matthew's apostolic authority validates connections not explicit in the original text. Jews require the prophecy to be clearly messianic in its original context; Christians see progressive revelation revealing deeper meanings.
