> **Fulfillment Category:** Complete Fulfillment

> This prophecy contains specific, verifiable details that were demonstrably fulfilled in Jesus' documented life. The evidence includes the dual fulfillment of being crucified between two criminals (buried with the wicked) and being buried in Joseph of Arimathea's wealthy tomb (with the rich in his death).

## The Prophecy

> And they made **his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death**, although **he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth**. Yet it was the will of the LORD to crush him; he has put him to grief; **when his soul makes an offering for guilt**, he shall see his offspring; he shall prolong his days; the will of the LORD shall prosper in his hand. — Isaiah 53:9-10 (ESV)

Buried with the wicked yet in a *rich man's tomb*. Sinless yet treated as a *guilt offering*. And remarkably—*he shall prolong his days* (life after death).

## Fulfillment in Jesus

**Buried with wicked:**
Jesus was crucified between two criminals:

> And with him they crucified **two robbers, one on his right and one on his left**. — Mark 15:27 (ESV)

**Yet in rich man's tomb:**

> When it was evening, there came **a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph**, who also was a disciple of Jesus. He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud and **laid it in his own new tomb**, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. — Matthew 27:57-60 (ESV)

**Sinless:**

> He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. — 1 Peter 2:22 (ESV)

Even his enemies couldn't identify any sin:

> Which one of you convicts me of sin? — John 8:46 (ESV)

Pilate declared:

> I find no guilt in this man. — Luke 23:4 (ESV)

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Crucified with criminals** (Mark 15:27; Luke 23:32): Numbered with transgressors
- **Joseph's tomb** (Matthew 27:57-60): Rich man provided burial place
- **Sinlessness affirmed** (1 Peter 2:22; John 8:46; 2 Corinthians 5:21): No sin found
- **Guilt offering** (Hebrews 10:10-14): His sacrifice atones for sin
- **Prolonged days** (Acts 2:24-32): Rose from dead, lives forever

## Christian Perspective

### Response

The dual nature of Jesus' burial—associated with criminals (crucified between them) yet buried in a rich man's tomb (Joseph of Arimathea)—remarkably fulfills this specific prophecy. The combination is unusual and precisely matches Isaiah's words written 700 years earlier.

## Assessment

**Christian View**: Jesus perfectly fulfilled this compound prophecy—executed with criminals yet buried by a rich man, sinless yet dying as a guilt offering.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Yes. The historical fulfillment is precise and remarkable: crucified between two criminals (association with wicked) but buried in Joseph of Arimathea's new tomb (rich man). The specificity of this dual fulfillment is striking—it would be extraordinarily difficult to fabricate such circumstances to match a prophecy.
