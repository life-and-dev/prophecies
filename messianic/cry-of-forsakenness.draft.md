## The Prophecy

> **My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?** — Psalm 22:1 (ESV)

## Fulfillment in Jesus

> And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?" that is, **"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"** — Matthew 27:46 (ESV)

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Exact quotation** (Matthew 27:46; Mark 15:34): Jesus quoted Psalm 22:1 word-for-word from the cross

Jesus quoted Psalm 22's opening words on the cross—experiencing the spiritual anguish David prophetically described.

## Jewish Perspective

*See "Jewish Perspective on Psalm 22 (Overview)" in main document—Jews view this as David's personal lament, not messianic prophecy.*

## Christian Perspective

### Response

Jesus' cry from the cross, quoting Psalm 22:1 exactly, demonstrates he was experiencing what David prophetically wrote. The context of Psalm 22 describes crucifixion details David couldn't have witnessed, suggesting prophetic intent.

## Assessment

**Christian View**: Jesus fulfilled Psalm 22:1 by crying out these exact words during crucifixion, experiencing the forsakenness David described.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Yes. Jesus explicitly quoted this verse from the cross—a direct verbal fulfillment documented by eyewitnesses. The question is whether Psalm 22 was prophetic or Jesus was simply praying a familiar lament psalm.
