# One Like a Son of Man Receives Dominion

## The Prophecy

> I saw in the night visions, and behold, **with the clouds of heaven there came one like a son of man, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him**. And **to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom, that all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him; his dominion is an everlasting dominion**, which shall not pass away, **and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed**. — Daniel 7:13-14 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

After His resurrection, Jesus declared:

> And Jesus came and said to them, **"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me**. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age." — Matthew 28:18-20 (ESV)

Jesus explicitly used "Son of Man" as His primary self-designation (over 80 times in the Gospels). At His trial before the Sanhedrin, when asked if He was the Christ, Jesus directly quoted Daniel 7:13:

> And Jesus said, "I am, and **you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven**." — Mark 14:62 (ESV)

Jesus also spoke of His future return:

> And then they will see **the Son of Man coming in clouds** with great power and glory. — Mark 13:26 (ESV)

### Christian

Christians believe Jesus is the Son of Man who received all authority from the Ancient of Days, arguing that:

**Jesus' Self-Identification**: Jesus explicitly used "Son of Man" as His primary self-designation throughout His ministry. At His trial, He directly quoted Daniel 7:13, identifying Himself as the Son of Man who would be seated at God's right hand and coming on clouds (Mark 14:62). This was not accidental—Jesus deliberately connected Himself to Daniel's prophecy.

**Coming to Ancient of Days Fulfilled at Ascension**: Christians see Daniel 7:13 fulfilled at Jesus' ascension. Jesus was taken up in clouds (Acts 1:9-11) and presented to the Father in heaven, receiving all authority. Jesus explicitly claims, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me" (Matthew 28:18), directly matching Daniel 7:14's "to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom."

**Two-Stage Fulfillment**:
- **First Coming/Ascension**: Authority received through ascension to the Ancient of Days; kingdom inaugurated spiritually
- **Second Coming**: Visible manifestation when He comes "on clouds" (Mark 13:26; Revelation 1:7) to establish visible universal kingdom on earth

**Progressive Universal Service**: While not yet universal, Christianity has spread to every nation on earth—billions of people across all peoples, nations, and languages serve Jesus. The progression toward universal dominion is actively underway through the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19).

**Indestructible Kingdom**: Despite persecution and Jesus' crucifixion, He rose from the dead and His kingdom has endured for 2,000 years, growing exponentially. The kingdom cannot be destroyed because the King lives forever through resurrection.

However, whether Daniel 7:13-14 refers to an individual Messiah is disputed:

### Jews

**Debated whether individual or collective.** Jewish scholars offer differing interpretations:

1. **"Son of Man" Represents Israel Collectively**: Many Jewish scholars interpret "one like a son of man" (*bar enash* in Aramaic) as symbolizing Israel collectively, not an individual Messiah. Daniel 7's context supports this interpretation. Four beasts represent four kingdoms (Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome), then "one like a son of man" (a human figure) contrasts with the beastly kingdoms, representing Israel or "the saints of the Most High" receiving God's kingdom. Daniel 7:18, 22, and 27 explicitly state "the saints of the Most High shall receive the kingdom"—indicating the human figure represents the collective people of God, not one individual.

2. **Future Event, Not Yet Fulfilled**: Even Jewish scholars who interpret this as referring to an individual Messiah argue it describes a future event—Messiah coming "with clouds of heaven" in visible, glorious manifestation to establish God's kingdom on earth. Jesus did not fulfill this during His earthly ministry. There was no visible coming on clouds, no universal recognition, and no establishment of God's kingdom on earth during Jesus' lifetime.

3. **Comes to Ancient of Days, Not to Earth**: The text states the son of man comes "**to** the Ancient of Days" (God in heaven), not **to earth**. This depicts a heavenly throne room scene—Israel's representative or the Messiah approaching God's throne to receive authority, not describing Messiah's arrival on earth to rule. Christians' application to ascension requires reading this as already fulfilled, while the plain meaning suggests a future eschatological event.

4. **Universal Visible Kingdom Required**: Daniel 7:14 promises "**all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him**"—requiring visible, universal acknowledgment and submission. The world does not universally serve Jesus as king. Most people today are not Christians. A genuine fulfillment requires all nations visibly serving the Messiah, not merely having Christian minorities in various countries.

5. **Everlasting Dominion Not Established**: The prophecy describes "an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away" and "his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed." Yet Jesus was crucified, Christianity has been persecuted throughout history, and there is no visible earthly kingdom ruled by Jesus from Jerusalem. An everlasting dominion should be uninterrupted and invincible, not beginning with crucifixion and requiring invisible spiritual reinterpretation.

6. **"Son of Man" as Humble Title**: Jesus' use of "Son of Man" could simply mean "human being" (the Aramaic/Hebrew term's basic meaning), emphasizing His humanity and messianic hiddenness rather than claiming to be Daniel's apocalyptic figure. The phrase occurs frequently in Ezekiel (over 90 times) simply meaning "mortal man," so Jesus may have used it to emphasize His identification with humanity.

## Conclusion

**Debatable fulfillment.** Jesus explicitly and repeatedly used "Son of Man" as His primary self-designation, deliberately connecting Himself to Daniel 7:13 by quoting it at His trial (Mark 14:62) and predicting His return on clouds (Mark 13:26). After His resurrection, Jesus claimed, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me" (Matthew 28:18), matching Daniel 7:14's description. Christians interpret Jesus' ascension as the "coming to the Ancient of Days" to receive authority, with the visible coming on clouds to establish universal kingdom awaiting the second coming. Christianity has indeed spread to all nations, with billions serving Jesus across diverse peoples and languages. However, fundamental interpretive differences exist: whether "son of man" represents an individual Messiah or collective Israel (Daniel 7:18,22,27 explicitly mentions "saints of the Most High" receiving the kingdom), whether coming "to the Ancient of Days" describes ascension to heaven or remains a future event, whether universal service can be progressive/spiritual or must be immediate and complete, and whether the everlasting kingdom can exist spiritually despite persecution or requires visible political establishment. The visible universal kingdom where all peoples serve him remains incomplete, and most of the world does not acknowledge Jesus as king. The interpretation depends on accepting either progressive/two-stage fulfillment (first coming inaugurates, second coming consummates) or requiring complete immediate fulfillment as originally expected.
