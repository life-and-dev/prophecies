# Seventy Weeks Are Decreed

## The Prophecy

> Seventy weeks are decreed about your people and your holy city, **to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness**, to seal both vision and prophet, and to anoint a most holy place. Know therefore and understand that **from the going out of the word to restore and build Jerusalem to the coming of an anointed one, a prince**, there shall be seven weeks. Then for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with squares and moat, but in a troubled time. And **after the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing**. And the people of the prince who is to come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary. Its end shall come with a flood, and to the end there shall be war. Desolations are decreed. — Daniel 9:24-26 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

Jesus appeared during the first century AD, claiming to be the anointed one:

> The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because **he has anointed me** to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed, to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. — Luke 4:18-19 (ESV)

Jesus was crucified (cut off) and accomplished atonement:

> For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and **to give his life as a ransom for many**. — Mark 10:45 (ESV)

> For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become **the righteousness of God**. — 2 Corinthians 5:21 (ESV)

> Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, **to make propitiation for the sins of the people**. — Hebrews 2:17 (ESV)

Jerusalem was destroyed by Rome in 70 AD, after Jesus was cut off.

### Christian

Christians believe Jesus fulfilled Daniel's prophecy, arguing that:

**Timeline Fits Jesus**: While calculations are debated, the general timeframe works. Most conservative Christian scholars use Artaxerxes' decree to Nehemiah (445 BC, Nehemiah 2:1-8) as the starting point. Sixty-nine weeks of years (483 years using prophetic 360-day years) brings the timeline to approximately Jesus' public ministry (around AD 30). The Messiah was then "cut off" (crucified), and Jerusalem was subsequently destroyed in 70 AD—the sequence matches Daniel's prophecy.

**"Cut Off" as Substitutionary Death**: While the Hebrew *yikaret* (cut off) can mean punishment, it can also mean executed unjustly or as a substitute. Isaiah 53:8 uses the same term for the suffering servant: "he was cut off out of the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was stricken." This describes vicarious death, not punishment for personal sin. The phrase "shall have nothing" describes the Messiah's earthly state—rejected, without kingdom or earthly honor—but not failure of mission. Jesus was cut off, had nothing in this world, yet accomplished atonement.

**Six Goals—Progressive Fulfillment**: Christians argue the six goals listed in Daniel 9:24 were inaugurated at Jesus' first coming with full realization at His second coming:
- **Finish transgression**: Jesus dealt with sin's root through atonement (Romans 6:10; Hebrews 9:26-28)
- **Put an end to sin**: Provision for sin's end made; full realization at second coming (Hebrews 9:28; Revelation 21:27)
- **Atone for iniquity**: Accomplished at the cross (Romans 3:25; 1 John 2:2)
- **Bring everlasting righteousness**: Christ's righteousness imputed to believers (Romans 3:21-22; 2 Corinthians 5:21)
- **Seal vision and prophet**: Jesus fulfills all prophecy; New Testament revelation completes prophetic word (Luke 24:44; Hebrews 1:1-2)
- **Anoint most holy place**: Jesus is the true temple (John 2:19-21); believers are anointed as God's holy place (1 Corinthians 3:16; Ephesians 2:21-22)

**Not Antiochus Epiphanes**: Daniel 9:26 states the "people of the prince" will "**destroy** the city and the sanctuary." Antiochus IV Epiphanes desecrated the temple in 167 BC but did not destroy it. The Romans completely destroyed both city and sanctuary in 70 AD—a better fit. Additionally, the destruction comes "after" the anointed one is cut off. If the anointed one is Onias III (killed around 170 BC) and the destruction is by Antiochus (167 BC), the timing is extremely close. Jesus was crucified (AD 30-33), then Jerusalem was destroyed (70 AD), a 37-40 year gap that better fits "after."

**Messianic Context in Daniel**: Daniel's broader prophetic context—the stone crushing kingdoms (Daniel 2), the Son of Man receiving eternal dominion (Daniel 7), and the Messiah cut off (Daniel 9)—all point to future divine intervention establishing God's kingdom, not merely Second Temple period history. Daniel 9's goals (atonement, everlasting righteousness) align with Jeremiah's new covenant prophecy (Jeremiah 31:31-34), which Christians see fulfilled in Jesus.

### Jews

**Highly debated; multiple interpretations.** Jewish scholars offer several alternative interpretations:

1. **Already Fulfilled in Second Temple Period**: Many Jewish interpreters argue this prophecy was fulfilled during the Second Temple era, not pointing to Jesus:
   - **"Anointed one" = Cyrus or Joshua**: The first anointed one (verse 25) refers to Cyrus the Persian king who decreed temple rebuilding (Isaiah 45:1 calls Cyrus "anointed"), or Joshua the high priest who led temple restoration (Zechariah 3-4)
   - **"Anointed one cut off" = Onias III**: The second anointed one who is "cut off" (verse 26) refers to Onias III, the righteous high priest murdered around 170 BC during the Maccabean period (described in 2 Maccabees 4:34). His death preceded the temple's desecration by Antiochus IV Epiphanes
   - **Destruction by Antiochus**: The "prince who is to come" who destroys the city and sanctuary (verse 26) is Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who desecrated the temple in 167 BC, not the Romans in 70 AD

2. **Timeline Calculations Disputed**:
   - **Starting point unclear**: "The word to restore and build Jerusalem" (verse 25) could refer to: (a) Cyrus' decree (538 BC), (b) Artaxerxes' decree to Ezra (458 BC), or (c) Artaxerxes' decree to Nehemiah (445 BC). Different starting points yield different end dates
   - **"Weeks" interpretation**: Some Jewish interpreters argue *shabuim* (weeks) means literal weeks (7-day periods), not "weeks of years" (490 years). This would place fulfillment much sooner, in the Persian period
   - **Mathematics problematic**: Even using "weeks of years" (490 years), calculations from any reasonable decree date do not land precisely on Jesus' ministry or crucifixion. Christians use various methods (prophetic 360-day years, gaps, recalculations) that Jews view as manipulating numbers to force a desired outcome

3. **Messiah Not "Cut Off" in Positive Sense**: The Hebrew *yikaret* (cut off) typically means "executed as punishment" or "destroyed." It is a negative term used for covenant-breakers (Genesis 17:14; Exodus 12:15; Leviticus 17:10). Jewish scholars argue this does not describe the Messiah's redemptive death but rather someone being killed as punishment or tragedy. The phrase "shall have nothing" (verse 26) suggests the anointed one dies without achieving his purposes—hardly fitting for a successful messianic mission.

4. **Six Goals Not Accomplished**: Daniel 9:24 lists six goals: finish transgression, put an end to sin, atone for iniquity, bring everlasting righteousness, seal vision and prophet, anoint most holy place. Jewish scholars argue these were not accomplished by Jesus:
   - Sin continues in the world
   - Prophecy did not end (though Jewish prophecy ceased around 400 BC)
   - The Most Holy Place was not anointed (the temple was destroyed instead)
   - Everlasting righteousness was not established globally

5. **Contextual Interpretation**: Daniel is in Babylonian exile (Daniel 9:2) pondering Jeremiah's prophecy of 70 years of exile. God's answer (70 "weeks") extends the timeframe but relates to the same issue—Israel's exile, restoration, and Second Temple period. The entire prophecy concerns events leading up to and through the Second Temple period, culminating in the Maccabean crisis and restoration, not events 500+ years in Daniel's future.

6. **Traditional Rabbinic Interpretation**: Traditional rabbinic sources (Talmud, medieval commentaries) rarely interpret Daniel 9:24-27 as messianic. The focus is on understanding historical fulfillment in Persian and Greek periods. Messianic interpretations became more prominent in Jewish-Christian debates but are not the dominant Jewish reading.

## Conclusion

**Debatable fulfillment.** Daniel 9:24-26 is one of the most complex and contested prophecies, with Christians and Jews offering substantially different interpretations. Christians argue the general timeframe fits Jesus' ministry (using Artaxerxes' 445 BC decree and prophetic 360-day years), the Messiah being "cut off" matches His crucifixion as substitutionary atonement, the six goals were inaugurated at His first coming with full realization at the second coming, and Jerusalem's destruction by Rome in 70 AD (after Jesus was cut off) fits the prophetic sequence. Jewish objections are substantial: precise timeline calculations are disputed with different starting points yielding different results, an alternative historical fulfillment in the Second Temple period (Onias III murdered, Antiochus desecrating the temple) is plausible, the six goals arguably were not accomplished, and *yikaret* (cut off) is typically a negative term suggesting punishment rather than redemptive death. The interpretation hinges on how to calculate the seventy weeks (starting point, year length, gaps), whether "cut off" describes substitutionary death or punishment, whether the six goals must be fully and immediately realized or can be inaugurated progressively, and whether the destruction refers to Antiochus' 167 BC desecration or Rome's 70 AD destruction. Both interpretive frameworks offer internal coherence, making this genuinely debatable prophecy.
