# Daniel's Seventy Weeks

## The Prophecy

The prophet Daniel received a vision specifying *when* the Messiah would appear:

> Seventy weeks are decreed about your people and your holy city, to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness... Know therefore and understand that from the going out of the word to restore and build Jerusalem to **the coming of an anointed one, a prince**, there shall be seven weeks. Then for sixty-two weeks it shall be built again with squares and moat, but in a troubled time. And **after the sixty-two weeks, an anointed one shall be cut off and shall have nothing**. — Daniel 9:24-26 (ESV)

The Messiah ("anointed one") would:
- Appear at a specific time (after 69 "weeks" from decree to rebuild Jerusalem)
- Be "cut off" (executed)
- Bring atonement for sin and everlasting righteousness

## Fulfillment in Jesus

Multiple interpretive frameworks exist for calculating the timeline (Jewish, Maccabean, Preterist, Futurist views differ on starting points and calculations). However, the core prediction stands: the Messiah would come, be cut off, and accomplish atonement during a specific historical window.

Jesus appeared during the first century AD:
- Began ministry ~26-30 AD
- Crucified ~30-33 AD (was "cut off")
- Accomplished atonement through his death
- Jerusalem destroyed by Rome in 70 AD (fulfilling "destroy the city and the sanctuary")

The timing aligns with Daniel's prophecy that the Messiah would be "cut off" before Jerusalem's destruction.

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Anointed one** (Luke 4:18-21): Jesus claimed to be anointed by Spirit
- **Cut off** (Mark 10:45): Jesus said he came to give his life
- **Atonement** (Romans 3:25; Hebrews 2:17): Jesus made atonement for sins
- **Everlasting righteousness** (2 Corinthians 5:21): Righteousness through Christ
- **Timing**: Appeared and was crucified before Jerusalem destroyed (70 AD)

## Jewish Perspective

### Messianic Status

**Highly Debated; Multiple Interpretations.** Daniel 9:24-27 is one of the most contested prophecies.

### Jewish Objections

**(1) Already fulfilled in Second Temple period**: Many Jews argue this was fulfilled during the Second Temple era, not pointing to Jesus:
- **"Anointed one" = Cyrus or Joshua the High Priest**: The first anointed one (9:25) refers to Cyrus the Persian king who decreed temple rebuilding (Isaiah 45:1 calls Cyrus "anointed"), or Joshua the high priest who led temple restoration (Zechariah 3-4).
- **"Anointed one cut off" = Onias III**: The second anointed one who is "cut off" (9:26) refers to Onias III, the righteous high priest murdered ~170 BC during the Maccabean period (described in 2 Maccabees 4:34). His death preceded temple's desecration by Antiochus IV Epiphanes.
- **Destruction by Antiochus**: The "prince who is to come" who destroys the city and sanctuary (9:26) is Antiochus IV Epiphanes, who desecrated the temple in 167 BC, not the Romans in 70 AD.

**(2) Timeline calculations disputed**:
- **Starting point unclear**: "The word to restore and build Jerusalem" (9:25) could refer to: (a) Cyrus' decree (538 BC), (b) Artaxerxes' decree to Ezra (458 BC), (c) Artaxerxes' decree to Nehemiah (445 BC). Different starting points yield different end dates.
- **"Weeks" are not years**: Some Jewish interpreters argue "weeks" (shabuim) means literal weeks (7-day periods), not "weeks of years" (490 years). This would place fulfillment much sooner, in the Persian period.
- **Math doesn't work**: Even using "weeks of years" (490 years), calculations from any reasonable decree date don't land precisely on Jesus' ministry or crucifixion. Christians use various methods (prophetic years, gaps, recalculations) that Jews see as manipulating the numbers.

**(3) Messiah not "cut off" in a good sense**:
- The Hebrew "yikaret" (cut off) typically means "executed as punishment" or "destroyed"—it's a negative term (Genesis 17:14; Exodus 12:15; Leviticus 17:10). Jews argue this doesn't describe Messiah's redemptive death but rather someone being killed as punishment or tragedy.
- The phrase "shall have nothing" (9:26) suggests the anointed one dies without achieving his purposes—hardly fitting for a successful messianic mission.

**(4) Atonement already accomplished**:
- Daniel 9:24 lists six goals: "finish transgression, put an end to sin, atone for iniquity, bring everlasting righteousness, seal vision and prophet, anoint most holy place."
- Jews argue these weren't accomplished by Jesus: sin continues, prophecy didn't end (though it did cease around 400 BC for Jews), the Most Holy Place wasn't anointed (the temple was destroyed instead), and everlasting righteousness wasn't established globally.

**(5) Contextual interpretation**:
- Daniel is in Babylonian exile (Daniel 9:2) pondering Jeremiah's prophecy of 70 years of exile. God's answer (70 "weeks") extends the timeframe but relates to the same issue—Israel's exile, restoration, and Second Temple period.
- The entire prophecy concerns events leading up to and through the Second Temple period, culminating in the Maccabean crisis and restoration. It's not about events 500+ years in Daniel's future.

**(6) Messianic interpretation is minority**:
- Traditional rabbinic sources (Talmud, medieval commentaries) rarely interpret Daniel 9:24-27 as messianic. The focus is on understanding historical fulfillment in Persian/Greek periods.
- Messianic interpretations became more prominent in Jewish-Christian debates but are not the dominant Jewish reading.

## Christian Perspective

### Responses to Jewish Objections

#### 1. Timing Fits Jesus

While calculations are debated, the general timeframe works:
- Most conservative Christian scholars use Artaxerxes' decree to Nehemiah (445 BC) as starting point
- 69 weeks of years (483 years using prophetic 360-day years) brings timeline to approximately Jesus' ministry (~AD 30)
- The Messiah was "cut off" (crucified) and then Jerusalem was destroyed (70 AD)—the sequence matches

#### 2. "Cut Off" as Substitutionary Death

**Ambiguous term**: While "cut off" can mean punishment, it can also mean executed unjustly or as substitute. Isaiah 53:8 uses the same term for the suffering servant: "he was cut off out of the land of the living; for the transgression of my people he was stricken." This is vicarious, not punishment for his own sin.

**"Shall have nothing"**: This describes the Messiah's earthly state—rejected, without kingdom or honor—not failure of mission. Jesus was cut off, had nothing in this world, yet accomplished atonement.

#### 3. Six Goals Progressive Fulfillment

**Finish transgression**: Jesus dealt with sin's root through atonement (Romans 6:10; Hebrews 9:26-28)
**Put an end to sin**: Provision for sin's end made; full realization at second coming (Hebrews 9:28; Revelation 21:27)
**Atone for iniquity**: Accomplished at the cross (Romans 3:25; 1 John 2:2)
**Bring everlasting righteousness**: Christ's righteousness imputed to believers (Romans 3:21-22; 2 Corinthians 5:21)
**Seal vision and prophet**: Jesus fulfills all prophecy; New Testament revelation completes prophetic word (Luke 24:44; Hebrews 1:1-2)
**Anoint most holy place**: Jesus is the true temple (John 2:19-21); believers are anointed as God's holy place (1 Corinthians 3:16; Ephesians 2:21-22)

Christians argue these were inaugurated at Jesus' first coming with full realization at second coming.

#### 4. Not Antiochus Epiphanes

**Temple desecration vs. destruction**: Antiochus desecrated the temple (167 BC), but Daniel 9:26 says the "people of the prince" will "destroy the city and the sanctuary." The Romans completely destroyed both in 70 AD—a better fit.

**After Messiah cut off**: The destruction comes "after" the anointed one is cut off (9:26). If the anointed one is Onias III (killed ~170 BC) and the destruction is by Antiochus (167 BC), the timing is too close. Jesus was crucified (AD 30-33), then Jerusalem destroyed (70 AD)—a 37-40 year gap fits "after."

**"People of the prince"**: The Romans (people of the coming prince/antichrist) destroyed Jerusalem, fitting the prophecy better than Antiochus.

#### 5. Messianic Context

**Daniel's broader context**: Daniel 2 (stone crushing kingdoms), Daniel 7 (Son of Man receiving kingdom), and Daniel 9 (Messiah cut off) all point to a future divine intervention, not just Second Temple history.

**New covenant**: Daniel 9's goals (atonement, everlasting righteousness) align with Jeremiah's new covenant prophecy (Jeremiah 31:31-34), which Christians see fulfilled in Jesus.

## Assessment

**Christian View**: Daniel 9:24-26 prophesies the Messiah appearing, being cut off (executed), accomplishing atonement, before Jerusalem's destruction. Jesus fits this timeline and purpose—appearing, being crucified, providing atonement, before the Romans destroyed Jerusalem in 70 AD.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Debatable. The prophecy is complex with multiple legitimate interpretive approaches. Christian interpretation offers a coherent framework:
- General timeframe fits Jesus' ministry
- Messiah "cut off" matches crucifixion
- Atonement accomplished matches Jesus' salvific work
- Jerusalem destroyed after Messiah matches historical sequence

However, Jewish objections are substantial:
- Precise timeline calculations disputed
- Alternative historical fulfillment (Onias III, Antiochus) plausible
- Six goals arguably not fully accomplished
- "Cut off" typically negative term

The interpretation hinges on:
- How to calculate the 70 weeks (starting point, year length)
- Whether "cut off" is substitutionary (Christian) or punishment (Jewish)
- Whether goals must be fully/immediately realized or can be inaugurated progressively
- Whether the destruction refers to Antiochus' desecration or Rome's destruction
