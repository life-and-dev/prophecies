# Descended from Jesse

## The Prophecy

Isaiah specified the Messiah's lineage through Jesse (David's father):

> There shall come forth **a shoot from the stump of Jesse, and a branch from his roots** shall bear fruit. And **the Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him**:
> * the Spirit of wisdom and understanding,
> * the Spirit of counsel and might,
> * the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the LORD.
> And his delight shall be in the fear of the LORD.
>
> He shall not judge by what his eyes see, or decide disputes by what his ears hear, but **with righteousness he shall judge** the poor, and decide with equity for the meek of the earth; and **he shall strike the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his lips he shall kill the wicked**. **Righteousness shall be the belt of his waist**, and faithfulness the belt of his loins.
>
> — Isaiah 11:1-5 (ESV)

The Messiah would be Spirit-empowered and from David's family line.

Isaiah prophesied that the Messiah would judge and strike the wicked. Jesus confirmed He has this authority, but revealed a crucial distinction: believers who hear His word and trust in God escape this judgment entirely, passing from death to life. Only those who reject Him face the judgment Isaiah foretold. There is no contradiction.

## Fulfillment in Jesus

Matthew's genealogy traces Jesus through Jesse:

> The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham: Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers... and Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and **Obed the father of Jesse**, and **Jesse the father of David** the king. — Matthew 1:1-6 (ESV)

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Genealogical documentation** (Matthew 1:1-6): Jesus traced through Jesse and David
- **Spirit-empowerment** (Matthew 3:16): The Spirit descended on Jesus at baptism
- **Authority to judge** (John 5:22-30): Jesus given authority to execute judgment

Regarding the judgment Isaiah prophesied, Jesus warned:

> For the Father judges no one, but has given **all judgment to [the Son](https://son.ofgod.info)**, that all may honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him.
>
> Truly, truly, I say to you, **whoever hears my word and believes Him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment**, but has passed from death to life.
>
> Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of [the Son of God](https://son.ofgod.info), and **those who hear will live**. For as the Father has life in himself, so **He has granted the Son** also to have life in himself. And **He has given him authority to execute judgment**, because he is [the Son of Man](https://son.ofgod.info/son-of-man). Do not marvel at this, for an hour is coming when all who are in the tombs will hear his voice and come out, those who have done good to **the resurrection of life**, and those who have done evil to **the resurrection of judgment**.
>
> I can do nothing on my own. **As I hear, I judge, and my judgment is just**, because I seek not my own will but the will of Him who sent me.
>
> — John 5:22-30 (ESV)

## Jewish Perspective

### Messianic Status

**Accepted as Messianic.** Isaiah 11:1-5 is universally recognized in Jewish tradition as a prophecy about the Messiah.

### Jewish Objections

1. **Incomplete fulfillment of context**: The prophecy continues (Isaiah 11:6-9) describing a world where "the wolf shall dwell with the lamb" and "the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD," depicting universal peace and knowledge of God. Jews contend that since these conditions did not materialize during or after Jesus' lifetime, the prophecy remains unfulfilled.

2. **Literal judgment not performed**: The passage describes the Messiah "striking the earth with the rod of his mouth" and "killing the wicked." Jews interpret these actions as literal, visible judgment that Jesus did not perform during his earthly ministry.

3. **Universal peace absent**: Isaiah 11:6-9 describes a transformed world with no violence or destruction. The world continues in conflict, demonstrating that the Messiah has not yet come.

## Christian Perspective

### Responses to Jewish Objections

#### 1. Two-Stage Fulfillment

Christians understand this prophecy is only partially fulfilled. Jesus was indeed from the lineage of Jesse, but he still needs to judge the world for their sin. Jesus promised that he will return to do this in the future.

**First Coming (Past)**: Jesus fulfilled the genealogical requirement (descendant of Jesse), was Spirit-empowered (Matthew 3:16), and inaugurated the kingdom (Mark 1:15). He established spiritual authority to judge (John 5:22-30).

**Second Coming (Future)**: The visible judgment and transformation of creation awaits Christ's return. Revelation 19:11-16 describes Jesus returning to "strike the nations" and rule with a rod of iron—fulfilling the judgment aspect of Isaiah 11.

#### 2. Judgment Already Determined

Jesus explained that judgment has already occurred spiritually for those who believe:

**Believers escape judgment**: "Whoever hears my word and believes Him who sent me has eternal life. He does not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life" (John 5:24).

**Unbelievers already judged**: "Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe is condemned already, because he has not believed in the name of the only Son of God" (John 3:18).

The "striking" and "killing the wicked" refers to eternal judgment that occurs at the resurrection of judgment (John 5:29), not during the first coming.

#### 3. Progressive Kingdom

**Already but not yet**: Jesus taught that the kingdom grows gradually like a mustard seed (Matthew 13:31-33) before final consummation. The knowledge of the LORD has spread to billions across every nation through Christianity—unprecedented in scope, though not yet universal.

**Transformation in progress**: The peace Isaiah describes will be fully realized when Christ returns (Revelation 21:1-4). Currently, the "peace of God" transforms individual hearts (Philippians 4:7) as a foretaste of coming universal peace.

## Assessment

**Christian View**: Jesus is the shoot from Jesse's stump, Spirit-empowered and authorized to judge. His first coming established his identity and spiritual authority; his second coming will complete the visible judgment and transformation Isaiah prophesied.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Possibly. The genealogical connection is strong and documented. However, the fulfillment of judgment and universal peace requires acceptance of a two-stage messianic framework, which Jews reject as inconsistent with prophetic expectations.
