# Despised and Rejected

## The Prophecy

> **He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief**; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely **he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows**; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. — Isaiah 53:3-4 (ESV)

Social rejection and suffering on behalf of others.

## Fulfillment in Jesus

> He came to his own, and **his own people did not receive him**. — John 1:11 (ESV)

Even his brothers didn't believe:

> For not even his brothers believed in him. — John 7:5 (ESV)

The Jewish leaders sought to kill him:

> So the Jews sought all the more to kill him, because not only was he breaking the Sabbath, but he was even calling God his own Father, making himself equal with God. — John 5:18 (ESV)

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Rejected by own people** (John 1:11): His own nation refused him
- **Family unbelief** (John 7:5): Brothers didn't believe during his ministry
- **Religious leaders' hatred** (John 5:18; 11:53): Plotted to kill him
- **Abandoned by disciples** (Matthew 26:56): All fled at arrest
- **Crucified as criminal** (Luke 23:33): Ultimate rejection

## Jewish Perspective

*See "Jewish Perspective on Isaiah 52-53 (Overview)"—servant is Israel suffering among nations.*

## Christian Perspective

### Response

Jesus experienced complete rejection: by religious leaders, by his nation, even by family members initially. This profound rejection fulfills the prophecy's description of being "despised and rejected by men."

## Assessment

**Christian View**: Jesus perfectly fulfills the prophecy of being despised and rejected, experiencing social and religious rejection culminating in crucifixion.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Yes. The historical record clearly documents Jesus' rejection by Jewish leaders, his own people, and even temporary abandonment by disciples. The progression from rejection to crucifixion matches the prophecy's description.
