# Divine Sonship Declared

## The Prophecy

Psalm 2 presents God's decree concerning His anointed king:

> I will tell of the decree: The LORD said to me, **"You are my Son; today I have begotten you**. Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession... Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. Blessed are all who take refuge in him." — Psalm 2:7-8, 12 (ESV)

The Messiah would be called God's **Son**, receive the *nations* as inheritance, and deserve *worship* ("Kiss the Son").

## Fulfillment in Jesus

Paul's sermon explicitly connected this to Jesus' resurrection:

> So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said: ... We bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, this He has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus, as also it is written in the second Psalm, **"You are My Son, today I have begotten you."** — Acts 13:16, 32-33 (ESV)

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Paul's application** (Acts 13:32-33): Explicitly applies Psalm 2:7 to Jesus' resurrection
- **God's declaration** (Matthew 3:17; 17:5): God called Jesus "my beloved Son"
- **Hebrews quotation** (Hebrews 1:5; 5:5): Applies this to Jesus' divine Sonship
- **Nations as heritage** (Matthew 28:18-19): Jesus given all authority; disciples commissioned to all nations

The "begetting" referred to resurrection—divine validation of Jesus as God's Son.

## Jewish Perspective

### Messianic Status

**Debated Whether Messianic.** Psalm 2 is interpreted in various ways within Jewish tradition.

### Jewish Objections

1. **King David or Solomon**: Many Jewish commentators see this as describing David's or Solomon's coronation. "You are my Son" is understood as adoption language—God declaring the Davidic king as His representative, not literal divine sonship. Ancient Near Eastern kings commonly used such "son of god" language metaphorically.

2. **Future Messiah**: Some rabbinic sources do apply this to the Messiah, but emphasize "Son" as a title of honor and authority, not deity. The Messiah will be fully human, a descendant of David.

3. **Coronation context**: "Today I have begotten you" refers to the day of coronation when the king assumes office, not biological birth or resurrection. Christians' application to resurrection is seen as eisegesis.

4. **Inheritance not yet realized**: The psalm promises "the nations as your heritage" and rule "to the ends of the earth"—Jews argue Jesus never received visible dominion over all nations, so the prophecy remains unfulfilled.

## Christian Perspective

### Responses to Jewish Objections

#### 1. More Than Human King

**Divine Sonship**: While earthly kings were called "sons of God" metaphorically, Jesus' Sonship is unique. God publicly declared Jesus "my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased" (Matthew 3:17; 17:5)—unprecedented affirmation.

**Resurrection as begetting**: Paul explicitly connects "begotten" to resurrection (Acts 13:33). Through resurrection, Jesus was "declared to be the Son of God in power" (Romans 1:4).

**Eternal Sonship**: Hebrews 1:5 contrasts Jesus with angels, emphasizing unique Sonship. Hebrews 1:3 describes Jesus as "the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature."

#### 2. Progressive Fulfillment of Nations

**Already receiving**: Jesus declared "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me" (Matthew 28:18). The Great Commission ("make disciples of all nations") is the process of receiving the nations as inheritance.

**Partial fulfillment**: Christianity has spread to every continent and nation—billions worship Jesus across all peoples. While not yet universal, the scope is unprecedented.

**Future consummation**: Full visible dominion awaits the second coming (Revelation 11:15: "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ").

## Assessment

**Christian View**: Jesus is God's unique Son, declared through resurrection, receiving the nations as inheritance progressively, with full visible dominion at his return.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Possibly. The apostolic application to Jesus' resurrection is clear (Acts 13:33; Romans 1:4). God's public declarations of Sonship are unprecedented. However, the visible inheritance of nations remains incomplete, requiring acceptance of progressive/eschatological fulfillment. The interpretation depends on whether "Son" is metaphorical (Jewish view) or unique divine Sonship (Christian view), and whether "begetting" refers to coronation or resurrection.
