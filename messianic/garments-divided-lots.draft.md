# Garments Divided by Casting Lots

## The Prophecy

> **They divide my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots**. — Psalm 22:18 (ESV)

## Fulfillment in Jesus

> And when they had crucified him, **they divided his garments among them by casting lots**. — Matthew 27:35 (ESV)

John provides more detail:

> When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his garments and divided them into four parts, one part for each soldier; also his tunic. But the tunic was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom, so they said to one another, "Let us not tear it, but **cast lots for it to see whose it shall be**." This was to fulfill the Scripture which says, "They divided my garments among them, and for my clothing they cast lots." — John 19:23-24 (ESV)

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Garments divided** (Matthew 27:35): Soldiers divided clothes
- **Casting lots** (John 19:23-24): Gambled for seamless tunic
- **John's citation** (John 19:24): Explicitly cites Psalm 22:18 as fulfilled

## Jewish Perspective

*See "Jewish Perspective on Psalm 22 (Overview)"—ancient victors plundered defeated; not necessarily prophetic.*

## Christian Perspective

### Response

John explicitly states this fulfilled Scripture (Psalm 22:18). The detail that soldiers divided garments but cast lots for the seamless tunic shows how the prophecy was fulfilled precisely—both actions described in one verse occurred.

## Assessment

**Christian View**: Roman soldiers unknowingly fulfilled Psalm 22:18 by dividing Jesus' garments and casting lots for his tunic.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Yes. This was not something Jesus could orchestrate—Roman soldiers spontaneously did what David wrote 1000 years earlier. John's eyewitness account and explicit citation of the prophecy strengthen the case. The dual action (dividing + casting lots) matches the psalm's dual statement.
