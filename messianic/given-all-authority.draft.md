# Given All Authority

## The Prophecy

Daniel's apocalyptic vision foretold universal dominion:

> I saw in the night visions, and behold, with the clouds of heaven there came **one like a son of man**, and he came to the Ancient of Days and was presented before him. And **to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom**, that **all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him**; **his dominion is an everlasting dominion**, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom one that shall not be destroyed. — Daniel 7:13-14 (ESV)

## Fulfillment in Jesus

After his resurrection, Jesus declared:

> And Jesus came and said to them, **"All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me**. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations..." — Matthew 28:18-19 (ESV)

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Jesus claimed it** (Matthew 28:18): "All authority... has been given to me"
- **"Son of Man" title** (Mark 14:62): Jesus used this title for himself, alluding to Daniel 7:13
- **Universal commission** (Matthew 28:19): "Make disciples of all nations"
- **Eternal kingdom** (Luke 1:33): "Of his kingdom there will be no end"
- **Coming on clouds** (Mark 13:26): "They will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory"

## Jewish Perspective

### Messianic Status

**Debated Whether Individual or Collective.**

### Jewish Objections

1. **"Son of man" represents Israel**: Many Jewish scholars interpret "one like a son of man" (bar enash in Aramaic) as symbolizing Israel collectively, not an individual Messiah. Daniel 7's context supports this—four beasts represent four kingdoms (Babylon, Medo-Persia, Greece, Rome), then "one like a son of man" (human figure) contrasts with beastly kingdoms, representing Israel/the saints receiving God's kingdom (Daniel 7:18, 22, 27).

2. **Future event, not yet fulfilled**: Even Jews who interpret this as Messiah argue it describes a future event—Messiah coming "with clouds of heaven" in visible, glorious manifestation to establish God's kingdom on earth. Jesus didn't fulfill this during his earthly ministry.

3. **Comes to Ancient of Days, not to earth**: The text says son of man comes "to the Ancient of Days" (God), not to earth. This depicts a heavenly scene—Israel's representative approaching God's throne, not Messiah's arrival on earth.

4. **Universal visible kingdom required**: Daniel 7:14 promises "all peoples, nations, and languages should serve him"—requires visible, universal acknowledgment. The world does not universally serve Jesus as king; most people today are not Christians.

5. **Everlasting dominion not established**: The prophecy describes a kingdom that "shall not be destroyed." Yet Jesus was crucified, Christianity persecuted throughout history, and there's no visible earthly kingdom ruled by Jesus.

6. **"Son of man" as humble title**: Jesus' use of "Son of Man" could simply mean "human being" (the term's basic meaning), emphasizing humanity and messianic hiddenness, not claiming to be Daniel's apocalyptic figure.

## Christian Perspective

### Response

**Jesus' self-identification**: Jesus explicitly used "Son of Man" as his primary self-designation (over 80 times in Gospels). At his trial, when asked if he was the Christ, Jesus said, "You will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven" (Mark 14:62)—directly quoting Daniel 7:13 and Psalm 110:1.

**Coming to Ancient of Days fulfilled**: Christians see this fulfilled at Jesus' ascension (Acts 1:9-11)—he was taken up in clouds and presented to the Father, receiving all authority (Matthew 28:18).

**Authority already given**: Jesus explicitly claims "all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me" (Matthew 28:18), matching Daniel 7:14 ("to him was given dominion and glory").

**Two-stage fulfillment**:
- **First coming**: Authority received through ascension; kingdom inaugurated spiritually
- **Second coming**: Visible manifestation when he comes "on clouds" (Mark 13:26; Revelation 1:7) to establish visible universal kingdom

**Progressive universal service**: While not yet universal, Christianity has spread to every nation—billions across all peoples, nations, and languages serve Jesus. The progression toward universal dominion is underway.

**Indestructible kingdom**: Despite persecution and crucifixion, Jesus rose and his kingdom has endured 2,000 years, growing exponentially. The kingdom cannot be destroyed because the King lives forever.

## Assessment

**Christian View**: Jesus is the Son of Man who received all authority from the Ancient of Days at his ascension. His kingdom is being established progressively, with full visible manifestation awaiting his return on the clouds.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Possibly. Jesus' explicit self-identification as the Son of Man, his claim to have received all authority (Matthew 28:18), and his prediction of returning on clouds (Mark 13:26; 14:62) demonstrate deliberate connection to Daniel 7:13-14. However, the visible universal kingdom and complete subjugation of all peoples remains incomplete, requiring eschatological fulfillment. The interpretation depends on whether:
- Son of Man is individual (Christian) or collective Israel (Jewish)
- Coming to Ancient of Days is ascension (Christian) or future earthly arrival (Jewish)
- Universal service can be progressive (Christian) or must be immediate and complete (Jewish)
- Kingdom indestructibility is spiritual (Christian) or requires visible political permanence (Jewish)
