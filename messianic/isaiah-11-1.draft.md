# Descended from Jesse

## Prophecy

Isaiah specified the Messiah's lineage would come through **Jesse** (King David's father), describing him as a "branch" bearing fruit.

> There shall come forth a shoot from the stump of **Jesse**, and a **branch from his roots** shall bear fruit. And the **Spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him**... — Isaiah 11:1-2 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian View

The New Testament confirms Jesus' lineage and Spirit-anointing:
*   **Lineage:** Matthew 1:5-6 and Luke 3:32 trace Jesus' genealogy directly through Jesse and David.
*   **Spirit:** The Spirit descended upon Jesus at his baptism (Matthew 3:16).
*   **Justice:** Jesus preached righteousness and will return to judge the earth.

### Jewish View

This is universally accepted as a Messianic prophecy in Judaism ("The Branch" is a common messianic title). The difference lies in whether Jesus is the one who fulfilled it.

## Conclusion

**Partially fulfilled**

Jesus satisfied the genealogical requirement of being a descendant of Jesse and demonstrated the Spirit-empowered wisdom described in verses 1-2. However, the full righteous judgment of the earth and the peaceful kingdom described in verses 3-5 await his Second Coming.
