# The Key of David

## Prophecy

Isaiah prophesied regarding Eliakim, son of Hilkiah, that he would hold the authority of the house of David.

> "And I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David. He shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall shut, and none shall open." — Isaiah 22:22 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic View

Historically, Eliakim did replace the corrupt steward Shebna (2 Kings 18:18), fulfilling the immediate context.

### Christian View

The New Testament treats this passage typologically. In the Book of Revelation, Jesus explicitly applies this title and authority to himself:

> "The words of the holy one, the true one, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens." — Revelation 3:7 (ESV)

Christians see Eliakim as a "type" (foreshadowing) of Christ, who holds supreme authority over the Kingdom of God.

## Conclusion

**Christian fulfillment**

While historically fulfilled in Eliakim, the prophecy finds its ultimate spiritual fulfillment in Jesus Christ, who claimed the "Key of David" as his own eternal authority.
