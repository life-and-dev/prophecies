# Miracles of Healing

## Prophecy

Isaiah predicted that the coming of God to save His people would be accompanied by specific miraculous healings.

> Then the **eyes of the blind shall be opened**, and the **ears of the deaf unstopped**; then shall the **lame man leap like a deer**, and the **tongue of the mute sing for joy**. For waters break forth in the wilderness, and streams in the desert; — Isaiah 35:5-6 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian View

Christians believe this prophecy was literally fulfilled by Jesus of Nazareth during his earthly ministry. When John the Baptist was in prison and sent disciples to ask Jesus if he was the "one who is to come" (the Messiah), Jesus pointed to these specific miracles as his credentials.

> And Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you hear and see: **the blind receive their sight and the lame walk**, lepers are cleansed and **the deaf hear**, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them." — Matthew 11:4-5 (ESV)

The Gospels record numerous instances of these specific miracles:
*   **Blind:** Healing the man born blind (John 9), Bartimaeus (Mark 10:46-52).
*   **Deaf/Mute:** Healing the deaf man with a speech impediment (Mark 7:31-37).
*   **Lame:** Healing the paralytic (Mark 2:1-12), the man at the pool of Bethesda (John 5:1-9).

> And great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and they put them at his feet, and he healed them, so that the crowd wondered, when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel. — Matthew 15:30-31 (ESV)

### Jewish View

Jewish commentators generally view Isaiah 35 as a description of the future Messianic age or the ultimate redemption of Israel. While they acknowledge these are characteristics of the redemption, they do not believe Jesus fulfilled the broader context of the chapter, which includes the gathering of exiles, universal peace, and the "Way of Holiness" (Isaiah 35:8) where no unclean traveler passes. Since the world remains broken and the exiles were not fully gathered in Jesus' time, Judaism maintains this prophecy is unfulfilled or refers to a future time. Some interpretations also view these healings metaphorically as spiritual healing of the nation returning from exile.

## Conclusion

**Partially fulfilled**

Jesus explicitly cited this passage as evidence of his messianic identity, and the New Testament provides multiple eyewitness accounts of these specific physical miracles (blind seeing, deaf hearing, lame walking, mute speaking). However, the full cosmic restoration of Isaiah 35—including the desert blossoming, the Way of Holiness, and the gathering of exiles—awaits the future Messianic Kingdom.
