# The Beloved Servant of God

## Prophecy

Isaiah depicts the demeanor and mission of God's chosen servant:

> Behold **My servant**, whom I uphold, My chosen, **in whom My soul delights**; I have put **My Spirit upon him**; he will bring forth justice to the nations. He will not cry aloud or lift up his voice, or make it heard in the street; a **bruised reed he will not break**, and a faintly burning wick he will not quench; he will faithfully bring forth justice. He will not grow faint or be discouraged till he has established justice in the earth; and the coastlands wait for his law. — Isaiah 42:1-4 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian View

The Gospel of Matthew explicitly applies this passage to Jesus when He withdrew from the Pharisees and healed the multitudes, warning them not to make Him known.

> This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: "Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him... He will not quarrel or cry aloud... a bruised reed he will not break..." — Matthew 12:17-21 (ESV)

Evidence cited by Christians:
*   **God's Delight:** At Jesus' baptism, God declared, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased" (Matthew 3:17).
*   **Spirit-Filled:** The Spirit descended on Jesus at his baptism (Matthew 3:16).
*   **Gentleness:** Jesus was known for his compassion toward the outcasts ("bruised reeds") and sinners.
*   **Justice:** Jesus established spiritual justice through the Gospel and will establish final justice at his return.

### Jewish View

Jewish interpretations vary:
*   **National Israel:** The predominant view identifies the "servant" as the nation of Israel (see Isaiah 41:8), destined to be a light to nations.
*   **Isaiah:** Some view it as the prophet describing his own mission.
*   **Incomplete:** Jews argue that if it refers to the Messiah, it is unfulfilled because universal justice and peace have not yet been established on earth.

## Conclusion

**Partially fulfilled**

Jesus' life and ministry aligned closely with the "Suffering Servant" profile—gentle, Spirit-anointed, and pleasing to God. The character and specific actions of Jesus (healing, withdrawing from conflict, not breaking the bruised reed) fulfilled the prophecy's description of the Servant's demeanor. However, the ultimate establishment of global justice "in the earth" (verse 4) and the coastlands waiting for his law await the Second Coming.
