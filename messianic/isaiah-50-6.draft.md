# Shame and Spitting

## Prophecy

The third Servant Song details the physical abuse the servant would endure.

> "I gave my back to those who strike, and my cheeks to those who pull out the beard; I hid not my face from disgrace and spitting." — Isaiah 50:6 (ESV)

## Textual Variants

There is a significant difference between the Hebrew Masoretic Text (MT) and the Greek Septuagint (LXX) regarding the abuse to the cheeks:

*   **MT (Hebrew):** "my cheeks to those who pluck out the beard" (מָרַט *māraṭ*).
*   **LXX (Greek):** "my cheeks to blows/strikes" (ῥάπισμα *rhapisma* - a slap with the open hand).

The LXX does not mention the beard or hair at all.

## Fulfillment

### Christian View

The Gospels record that Jesus was scourged (struck on the back), beaten, and explicitly spat upon by Roman soldiers and religious leaders (Matthew 26:67, 27:26-30).

Regarding the cheeks: The Gospels record Jesus being struck and slapped (Matthew 26:67; Mark 14:65; John 18:22), which aligns precisely with the **LXX reading**. The Gospels make **no mention** of Jesus' beard being plucked out. This suggests the LXX preserves the reading that was historically fulfilled in Jesus, whereas the MT reading ("plucking the beard") was not recorded as fulfilled.

## Conclusion

**Christian fulfillment**

The prophecy of shameful abuse, beating, and spitting was literally fulfilled in Jesus. The specific detail of "slaps to the cheeks" (LXX) matches the historical record better than the "beard plucking" (MT), possibly indicating the LXX preserves the more accurate original text in this instance.
