# Exalted Yet Disfigured

## Prophecy

Isaiah describes a paradox: a servant who is highly exalted, yet whose appearance is brutally disfigured.

> Behold, **my servant shall act wisely; he shall be high and lifted up**, and shall be exalted. As many were astonished at you—**his appearance was so marred, beyond human semblance**, and his form beyond that of the children of mankind—so shall he sprinkle many nations... — Isaiah 52:13-15 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian View

Christians see a precise sequence of events here:
1.  **Marred Appearance:** Jesus was brutally scourged, beaten, crowned with thorns, and crucified (Matthew 27:26-30). The physical trauma was so severe he was "marred beyond human semblance."
2.  **Sprinkling Nations:** His blood provided atonement ("sprinkling," a priestly term) for people of all nations (1 Peter 1:2).
3.  **Exaltation:** Following his suffering, Jesus was resurrected and "highly exalted" to the right hand of God (Philippians 2:9).

> "God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name." — Philippians 2:9 (ESV)

### Textual Variants

*   **MT (Masoretic):** "He shall sprinkle (yazzah) many nations."
*   **LXX (Septuagint):** "He shall startle/astonish many nations."
    The Christian interpretation of "sprinkle" connects to the blood of the covenant/atonement, while "startle" connects to the reaction of kings. Both fit the narrative of the Cross's impact.

## Conclusion

**Christian fulfillment**

The prophecy accurately captures the dual nature of Jesus' passion: the extreme physical brutality of his execution ("marred") followed by his supreme elevation ("high and lifted up"). The "sprinkling" of nations was fulfilled as the Gospel spread to Gentiles, cleansing them through faith.
