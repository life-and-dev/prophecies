# Makes Many Righteous / Numbered with Transgressors

## Prophecy

Isaiah describes the result of the servant's suffering and his association with sinners.

> ...by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, **make many to be accounted righteous**, and he shall bear their iniquities... because he poured out his soul to death and **was numbered with the transgressors**... — Isaiah 53:11-12 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian View

**Numbered with Transgressors:**
Jesus explicitly cited this prophecy as applying to himself just before his arrest:
> "For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: 'And he was numbered with the transgressors.'" — Luke 22:37 (ESV)

It was physically fulfilled when he was crucified between two robbers (Mark 15:27).

**Makes Many Righteous:**
This is the theological core of the Gospel (Justification). Paul writes:
> "For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience [Jesus] the many will be made righteous." — Romans 5:19 (ESV)

## Conclusion

**Christian fulfillment**

Jesus consciously fulfilled the "numbered with transgressors" prediction, and the New Testament theology of justification rests on the fulfillment of the promise that he would "make many to be accounted righteous."
