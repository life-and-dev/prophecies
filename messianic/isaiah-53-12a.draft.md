# Exaltation and Victory

## Prophecy

Isaiah predicts that the servant's death is not the end. God promises him a portion with the great and the spoil with the strong as a reward for his sacrifice.

> Therefore **I will divide him a portion with the many, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong**, because he poured out his soul to death... — Isaiah 53:12 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian View

This predicts the resurrection and exaltation of Jesus. "Dividing the spoil" is imagery of a victorious general sharing the plunder of war.
*   **Victory:** By his resurrection, Jesus conquered Satan, sin, and death. "He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him." (Colossians 2:15).
*   **Reward:** Jesus was exalted to the highest place (Philippians 2:9) and shares his victory (the "spoil") with his people, giving gifts to the church (Ephesians 4:8).

## Conclusion

**Christian fulfillment**

The prophecy implies the servant survives his "death" (mentioned in the same verse) to receive a reward. Jesus' resurrection and subsequent exaltation fit this pattern of suffering followed by sovereign victory.
