# Intercession for Enemies

The ancient prophecies of Isaiah 53 describe a mysterious servant figure who endures immense suffering. Among the final predictions in this chapter is a remarkable act of compassion: the servant intercedes for the very people who have wronged him. This article explores this specific prophecy, examining how different faiths interpret its fulfillment and what it reveals about the nature of forgiveness and advocacy.

## Prophecy

The final act of the servant described is praying for the very people who considered him a sinner.

> "...yet he bore the sin of many, and **makes intercession for the transgressors**." — Isaiah 53:12 (ESV)

## Interpretations

### Christian View

This was literally fulfilled during the crucifixion. While being nailed to the cross or hanging upon it, Jesus prayed for his executioners:

> And Jesus said, "**Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.**" — Luke 23:34 (ESV)

Furthermore, Jesus continues to make intercession for believers as the High Priest in heaven:

> "Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them." — Hebrews 7:25 (ESV)

### Jewish View

In contrast, the prevailing view in Rabbinic Judaism is that the "servant" in Isaiah 53 refers to the nation of Israel. In this interpretation, Israel, personified as a single individual, endures immense suffering at the hands of gentile nations. The intercession, therefore, is not that of a single Messiah for his enemies, but rather the collective, righteous prayers of the people of Israel on behalf of the sinful nations of the world, or for the sinful members within its own community.

## Conclusion

The prophecy of the suffering servant making intercession for transgressors is interpreted in significantly different ways. The [Christian view](#christian-view) sees a literal fulfillment in Jesus' prayer on the cross for his executioners. In contrast, the [Jewish view](#jewish-view) understands the servant to be the nation of Israel, collectively praying for the nations.
