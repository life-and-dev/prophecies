# Intercession for Enemies

## Prophecy

The final act of the servant described is praying for the very people who considered him a sinner.

> "...yet he bore the sin of many, and **makes intercession for the transgressors**." — Isaiah 53:12 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian View

This was literally fulfilled during the crucifixion. While being nailed to the cross or hanging upon it, Jesus prayed for his executioners:

> And Jesus said, "**Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.**" — Luke 23:34 (ESV)

Furthermore, Jesus continues to make intercession for believers as the High Priest in heaven (Hebrews 7:25).

## Conclusion

**Christian fulfillment**

Jesus' specific prayer for his enemies while suffering at their hands is a striking and literal fulfillment of this prophetic detail.
