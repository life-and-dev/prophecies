# Intercession for Enemies

One of the most profound aspects of the servant's mission, as foretold by the prophet Isaiah, is his final act of compassion. This act, performed in a moment of great suffering, reveals a deep love for humanity. This article explores this specific prophecy and its fulfillment.

## Prophecy

The final act of the servant described is praying for the very people who considered him a sinner.

> "...yet he bore the sin of many, and **makes intercession for the transgressors**." — Isaiah 53:12 (ESV)

## Christian View

This was literally fulfilled during the crucifixion. While being nailed to the cross or hanging upon it, Jesus prayed for his executioners:

> And Jesus said, "**Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do.**" — Luke 23:34 (ESV)

Furthermore, Jesus continues to make intercession for believers as the High Priest in heaven:

> "Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them." — Hebrews 7:25 (ESV)

## Jewish View

The prevailing rabbinic interpretation of Isaiah 53 ascribes the "servant" to the nation of Israel who silently endured unimaginable suffering at the hands of its gentile oppressors. In this view, the "transgressors" are the gentile nations, and Israel's suffering is a form of intercession for them.

## Conclusion

The prophecy in [Isaiah 53:12](#prophecy) about the servant making intercession for transgressors is interpreted in distinct ways.

- The [Christian view](#christian-view) sees a literal fulfillment in Jesus of Nazareth, who prayed for his executioners during his crucifixion and is believed to continue his intercession in heaven.
- The predominant [Jewish view](#jewish-view) identifies the servant as the nation of Israel, suggesting their collective suffering serves as a form of intercession for the gentile nations.

Both interpretations highlight a theme of redemptive suffering and intercession, though they differ on the identity of the servant.
