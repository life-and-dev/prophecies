# No External Beauty

## Prophecy

Isaiah predicted the servant would arise from humble beginnings without the external trappings of royalty.

> For he grew up before him like a young plant, and like a root out of dry ground; **he had no form or majesty that we should look at him, and no beauty that we should desire him**. — Isaiah 53:2 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian View

This prophecy corrects the expectation that the Messiah would be a glorious, physically imposing king in a palace. Jesus fulfilled this by growing up in humble circumstances as a carpenter's son in Nazareth—a town of no repute ("Can anything good come out of Nazareth?" - John 1:46).

His authority came from his words and works, not from royal robes, political power, or physical "majesty" that would naturally attract worldly admiration. He was a "root out of dry ground"—life emerging from a spiritually dry nation and an insignificant location.

## Conclusion

**Christian fulfillment**

Jesus' humble life and lack of worldly "majesty" fit the counter-intuitive description of God's servant, who conquered through humility rather than royal display.
