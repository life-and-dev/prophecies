# Despised and Rejected

## Prophecy

Isaiah predicted the servant would face widespread rejection and deep sorrow.

> **He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief**; and as one from whom men hide their faces he was despised, and we esteemed him not. Surely **he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows**; yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God, and afflicted. — Isaiah 53:3-4 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian View

The New Testament documents the comprehensive rejection Jesus faced:
*   **By Leaders:** The Sanhedrin and religious authorities rejected his claims and sought his death.
*   **By His People:** "He came to his own, and his own people did not receive him" (John 1:11). The crowd chose Barabbas over him.
*   **By Disciples:** Judas betrayed him, Peter denied him, and "all the disciples left him and fled" (Matthew 26:56).
*   **By Family:** "For not even his brothers believed in him" (John 7:5).

Jesus was truly a "man of sorrows," weeping over Jerusalem and agonizing in Gethsemane. The prophecy that people would view him as "stricken by God" was fulfilled when crowds mocked him on the cross, assuming his suffering was proof of God's curse.

## Conclusion

**Christian fulfillment**

The prophecy accurately described the reception of Jesus: despite his miracles and teaching, he was ultimately despised and rejected by the very people he came to save, fulfilling the "man of sorrows" title.
