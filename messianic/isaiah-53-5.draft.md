# Pierced for Our Transgressions

## Prophecy

This passage is the heart of the "Suffering Servant" prophecy, describing vicarious atonement where the servant suffers for the sins of others.

> But **he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities**; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and **with his wounds we are healed**. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned—every one—to his own way; and **the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all**. — Isaiah 53:5-6 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian View

Christians see this as a literal and theological fulfillment in Jesus' crucifixion:
1.  **Literal Piercing:** Jesus was pierced by nails in his hands and feet and by a spear in his side (John 19:34, 20:27).
2.  **Vicarious Atonement:** The New Testament teaches that Jesus died as a substitute for sinners. "He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree" (1 Peter 2:24).
3.  **Peace and Healing:** "We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ" (Romans 5:1). The "healing" is primarily spiritual restoration (forgiveness), though physical healing is also an aspect of the Kingdom.

### Jewish View

Jewish interpreters (since Rashi in the Middle Ages) often view the "Suffering Servant" as the nation of Israel, suffering exile and persecution ("pierced" and "crushed") for the sake of the nations, to eventually bring them to God. However, older Jewish traditions (like the Targum Jonathan) did interpret Isaiah 53 as referring to the Messiah.

## Conclusion

**Christian fulfillment**

The correspondence between the prophecy's "piercing" and the specific mode of Jesus' death (crucifixion), combined with the theological explanation of his death as a substitutionary sacrifice ("for our transgressions"), provides the foundation for the Christian understanding of the Atonement.
