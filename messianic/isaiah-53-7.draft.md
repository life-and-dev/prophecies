# Silence Before Accusers

## Prophecy

Isaiah predicted the servant would submit to oppression without self-defense, comparing him to a lamb.

> "He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth; like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth." — Isaiah 53:7 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian View

This was fulfilled during Jesus' trial. Despite false accusations and the threat of death, Jesus remained silent, refusing to argue his case or beg for release.

> But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer. Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?" But **he gave him no answer**, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed. — Matthew 27:12-14 (ESV)

See also Mark 14:61. His silence was not out of inability to speak, but a deliberate submission to the Father's will, fulfilling the prophetic image of the sacrificial lamb.

## Conclusion

**Christian fulfillment**

Jesus' unusual refusal to defend himself against capital charges astonished the Roman governor and fulfilled the specific detail of the prophecy regarding the servant's silence.
