# Buried with the Rich

## Prophecy

Isaiah predicted a paradoxical burial scenario for the servant: assigned a grave with the wicked, yet ending up with a rich man.

> And they made **his grave with the wicked and with a rich man in his death**, although **he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth**. — Isaiah 53:9 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian View

This prophecy contains two seemingly contradictory details that were reconciled in the events of Jesus' death:
1.  **With the Wicked:** Jesus was crucified between two criminals (robbers) and would normally have been buried in a common grave for executed criminals (the "wicked").
2.  **With a Rich Man:** Instead, a wealthy disciple named Joseph of Arimathea asked Pilate for Jesus' body and buried him in his own new, rock-hewn tomb.

> When it was evening, there came **a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph**... He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus... and **laid it in his own new tomb**. — Matthew 27:57-60 (ESV)

The prophecy also affirms the servant's sinlessness ("no deceit in his mouth"), which the New Testament affirms of Jesus (1 Peter 2:22).

## Conclusion

**Christian fulfillment**

The unlikely combination of dying as a criminal yet receiving a dignitary's burial in a rich man's private tomb serves as a striking historical verification of this prophecy.
