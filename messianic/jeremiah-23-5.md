# Jeremiah 23:5-6 (The Righteous Branch)

The prophet Jeremiah prophesied about a future righteous king from David's line:

> "Behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when **I will raise up for David a righteous Branch**, and **he shall reign as king and deal wisely**, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days **Judah will be saved, and Israel will dwell securely**. And this is the name by which he will be called: **'The LORD is our righteousness.'"** — Jeremiah 23:5-6 (ESV)

The prophecy includes specific, measurable outcomes. A righteous descendant of David will reign as king and execute justice and righteousness in the land. **Judah will be saved** and **Israel will dwell securely**. He will be called "The LORD is our righteousness" (Hebrew: יְהוָה צִדְקֵנוּ, *Yahweh Tsidkenu*).

The broader context emphasizes the restoration of Israel:

> "Therefore, behold, the days are coming, declares the LORD, when they shall no longer say, 'As the LORD lives who brought up the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt,' but 'As the LORD lives who brought up and led the offspring of the house of Israel out of the north country and out of all the countries where he had driven them.' Then they shall dwell in their own land." — Jeremiah 23:7-8 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian View

Christians identify Jesus as the "righteous Branch" from David's line. Jesus is genealogically descended from David through both Mary and Joseph's lines (Matthew 1:1; Luke 3:23-31). The apostles repeatedly called Jesus "the Righteous One" (Acts 3:14, 7:52; 1 Peter 3:18; 1 John 2:1), and believers are declared righteous through faith in Him (Romans 3:21-26; 1 Corinthians 1:30; 2 Corinthians 5:21). Jesus reigns spiritually now (Acts 2:33-36; Philippians 2:9-11) and has been appointed by God to judge the living and the dead (Acts 10:42, 17:31; John 5:22,27). However, most Christians acknowledge that the physical, national promises of salvation and security for Judah and Israel await His second coming.

### Jewish View

Jeremiah 23:5-6 is universally recognized in Jewish tradition as a prophecy about the future Messiah and expects a literal king from David's line who will restore Israel's kingdom. Jews argue that the prophecy's explicit promises remain unfulfilled. Judah was not saved during or after Jesus' lifetime; instead, Judah remained under Roman occupation, Jerusalem and the Temple were destroyed in 70 AD, and the Jewish people were scattered in exile for nearly 2,000 years. Israel does not dwell securely; even modern Israel (re-established 1948) faces ongoing conflicts. Jesus never sat on a literal throne in Jerusalem or ruled as political king over Israel. The massive return from exile described in Jeremiah 23:7-8, comparable to the exodus from Egypt, has not occurred. Jews maintain that the prophecy requires complete, visible fulfillment of all elements before accepting someone as Messiah.

### Dialogue: Jewish Objections and Christian Responses

#### 1. Was Judah Saved?

**Jewish Objection:** The prophecy explicitly states "Judah will be saved" (verse 6), yet historically Judah was not saved during or after Jesus' lifetime. Judah remained under Roman occupation during Jesus' life, Jerusalem and the Temple were destroyed in 70 AD (forty years after Jesus' death), and the Jewish people were scattered in exile for nearly 2,000 years. The nation did not experience political salvation or deliverance.

**Christian Response:** Christians argue that "Judah will be saved" was fulfilled spiritually through Jesus. Thousands of Jews believed in Jesus (Acts 2:41; 4:4; 21:20 speaks of "many thousands among the Jews") and experienced spiritual salvation—forgiveness of sins, reconciliation with God, and eternal life—which is the deeper, more important salvation than political deliverance. Christians acknowledge the physical, national salvation has not yet occurred but argue this awaits Christ's second coming. Romans 11:25-27 promises "All Israel will be saved" as a future event, and Zechariah 12:10; 14:1-9 describe a future day when Israel will recognize their Messiah. Because Israel as a nation rejected Jesus, the physical kingdom blessings were postponed (Matthew 23:37-39; Luke 19:41-44). The "already but not yet" kingdom means spiritual salvation came first, while physical restoration comes later when they accept him at his return.

#### 2. Does Israel Dwell Securely?

**Jewish Objection:** The prophecy states "Israel will dwell securely" (verse 6), yet this has demonstrably not occurred. Israel was destroyed as a nation in 70 AD, Jews have been persecuted throughout history through pogroms, the Inquisition, and the Holocaust, and even modern Israel (re-established 1948) does not dwell in complete security but is surrounded by hostile neighbors with ongoing conflicts. The Hebrew word for "securely" (בֶּטַח, *betach*) means physical safety and security, not merely spiritual peace.

**Christian Response:** Christians argue the deepest security isn't political but eternal—victory over death. Jesus provides eternal security (John 10:28-29: "No one will snatch them out of my hand"). Christians point to prophecies about Christ's return when Israel will experience physical security. Ezekiel 34:25-28 promises that God's shepherd will make Israel "dwell securely" with no one to make them afraid, and Ezekiel 38:8,11,14 describes Israel dwelling securely before the final battle of Gog and Magog. These await the Messianic Age after Jesus' return. Many Christians acknowledge that complete physical security has not yet been achieved, supporting the two-comings framework.

#### 3. Where Is the Physical Kingdom?

**Jewish Objection:** The prophecy says "he shall reign as king" (verse 5), which Jews argue means a literal, visible political reign. Jesus never sat on a literal throne in Jerusalem, never ruled as political king over Israel, and was executed by the Romans as a criminal. No visible kingdom was established.

**Christian Response:** Christians argue Jesus does reign as king now, but spiritually. Acts 2:33-36 states God "made him both Lord and Christ," seated at God's right hand. Philippians 2:9-11 describes how God exalted Jesus and gave him the name above every name, and Revelation 1:5 calls Jesus "the ruler of kings on earth." His kingdom is "not of this world" (John 18:36) in its current phase. However, Revelation 20:4-6 describes Jesus reigning on earth for 1,000 years. Christians argue the visible, political reign from Jerusalem awaits the Second Coming (Zechariah 14:9, 16-17). The kingship exists but full manifestation is future—like a king in exile who will return to claim his throne.

#### 4. What About the Return from Exile?

**Jewish Objection:** Jeremiah 23:7-8 describes a massive return from exile comparable to the exodus from Egypt. While there was a partial return from Babylonian exile around 538 BC (before Jesus), the prophecy speaks of a future, greater gathering. Jesus did not accomplish this gathering of dispersed Israel.

**Christian Response:** Christians agree the return from Babylonian exile (around 538 BC) and even modern Israel's re-establishment (1948) don't fully satisfy Jeremiah 23:7-8's scope. They point to prophecies about a final, complete regathering when Messiah returns. Isaiah 11:11-12 promises God will "assemble the banished of Israel, and gather the dispersed of Judah," and Ezekiel 37:21-22 declares God will gather Israel from the nations and make them one nation under one king (David's descendant). Jesus referenced this in Matthew 24:31, speaking of gathering "his elect from the four winds." The prophecy began fulfillment spiritually with Jewish believers in Jesus, continues through Israel's preservation and return to the land, and will be completed at Christ's return.

#### 5. Why Divide Political Restoration into Two Comings?

**Jewish Objection:** The entire context of Jeremiah 23 addresses false shepherds (kings and leaders) who scattered the flock (Israel) and promises God will raise up a good shepherd (Messiah) who will gather and restore them. This is about national, political restoration—not spiritual salvation only. The prophecy describes one unified event, not multiple stages separated by millennia.

**Christian Response:** Christians acknowledge the tension but resolve it through the framework of two comings: the first coming (past) as the suffering servant of Isaiah 53 bringing spiritual salvation and inaugurating the kingdom, and the second coming (future) as the conquering king of Revelation 19 bringing physical restoration and consummating the kingdom. The prophets saw the Messiah's work as one event—like looking at two mountain peaks that appear as one from a distance. Only with New Testament revelation did it become clear there are two comings separated by time. Spiritual salvation had to come first, dealing with the sin problem, before the physical kingdom could be established. A righteous kingdom cannot exist with unrighteous hearts.

#### 6. Does "The LORD Is Our Righteousness" Prove Jesus Is God?

**Jewish Objection:** While Christians claim Jesus embodies this title, Jews argue it refers to the security and righteousness Israel will experience under Messiah's reign. The [Jewish Talmud recognizes "Jehovah Zidkenu" as one of the seven names of the Messiah](https://letthetruthcomeoutblog.wordpress.com/2023/08/03/why-jeremiah-236-is-not-a-proof-text-for-the-deity-of-messiah/), but it "never ever suggested to the prophets and sages of Israel that the Messiah would be divine or God himself." Most importantly, [Jerusalem itself receives this exact same name in Jeremiah 33:16](https://biblehub.com/jeremiah/33-16.htm) ("this is the name by which it will be called: The LORD Our Righteousness"), and Jerusalem is obviously not God. [Being "called" by a name containing YHWH doesn't mean literal identification with God](https://www.biblicalunitarian.com/verses/jeremiah-23-6)—it's an honor reflecting the righteousness bestowed upon them. Other biblical examples include [Abraham naming a mountain "the Lord will provide,"](https://www.biblicalunitarian.com/verses/jeremiah-23-6) Moses naming an altar "the Lord is my Banner" (Exodus 17:15), and Gideon naming an altar "The Lord is Peace" (Judges 6:24). The name is a declaration about the nation's condition under Messiah's righteous rule, not the Messiah's identity as God.

**Christian Response:** Christians argue the name "The LORD is our righteousness" indicates the Messiah's identity, not just Israel's condition. [Christian commentators see this as "an eminent proof of the Godhead of Christ"](https://biblehub.com/commentaries/jeremiah/23-6.htm) since the title uses the divine name YHWH (יְהוָה, *Yahweh*) and suggests the Messiah himself is the source of righteousness, not just a channel. While Christians acknowledge Jerusalem shares this name in Jeremiah 33:16, they argue [Jerusalem receives it derivatively, reflecting the righteousness the Messiah bestows](https://www.comelybankchurch.com/names-of-god-yahweh-tsidkenu/). Christians see this as evidence Jesus is divine—he doesn't just represent YHWH's righteousness but is YHWH who provides righteousness (John 8:58; 10:30). Believers are declared righteous through Jesus (2 Corinthians 5:21: "We might become the righteousness of God in him"). Jesus is literally "our righteousness" as Paul states in 1 Corinthians 1:30.

## Conclusion

**Partially fulfilled.** Jesus demonstrably fulfills some elements: Davidic descent, personal righteousness provided to believers, and wise spiritual rule. 

However, the explicit statements "Judah will be saved" and "Israel will dwell securely" remain visibly unfulfilled in their physical, national sense. The Jewish objection is textually strong — the prophecy makes specific, measurable claims about national salvation and physical security that have not occurred. 

Christians invoke the two-comings framework where spiritual salvation was accomplished at Jesus' first coming while physical salvation and secure dwelling for Israel await His second coming. Almost all Christians acknowledge significant aspects of Jeremiah 23:5-6 await future fulfillment. 

This prophecy highlights the central divide in Jewish-Christian messianic interpretation: Jews require complete, visible fulfillment of all prophetic elements before accepting someone as Messiah, while Christians accept partial fulfillment with remaining promises contingent on the second coming.
