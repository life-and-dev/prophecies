# Jeremiah 31:31-34 (The New Covenant)

## Prophecy

> “Behold, the days are coming, declares the **LORD**, when I will make a **new covenant** with the house of Israel and the house of Judah... I will **put my law within them**, and I will **write it on their hearts**. And I will be their God, and they shall be my people. And no longer shall each one teach his neighbor and each his brother, saying, ‘Know the **LORD**,’ for they shall all **know me**, from the least of them to the greatest... for I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more.” — Jeremiah 31:31-34 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian

Christians believe this prophecy was fulfilled in the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.
*   **Luke 22:20**: At the Last Supper, Jesus declares, "This cup that is poured out for you is the **new covenant** in my blood."
*   **Hebrews 8:8-12**: The author quotes the entire passage from Jeremiah, arguing that Jesus is the mediator of this better covenant.
*   **Hebrews 10:16-17**: Reaffirms that the Holy Spirit witnesses to this fulfillment through the internalization of God's law and the finality of Christ's sacrifice for sin.

### Jews

Jewish scholars interpret this passage as an unfulfilled prophecy awaiting the Messianic Age. They view the "law written on hearts" not as a replacement of the Torah, but as a future time of universal obedience and deepened devotion where the Jewish people will naturally desire to keep God's law without external enforcement.

## Conclusion

**Christian fulfillment**

According to the New Testament, this prophecy was fulfilled by Jesus Christ, who inaugurated the New Covenant. While Judaism awaits a future national fulfillment, the Christian scriptures explicitly identify Jesus' work as the realization of Jeremiah's prediction.
