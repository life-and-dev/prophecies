# Leader Who Approaches God

## The Prophecy

Jeremiah prophesied about a unique leader with unprecedented access to God:

> Their prince shall be one of themselves; their ruler shall come out from their midst. **I will make him draw near, and he shall approach me, for who would dare of himself to approach me?** declares the LORD. — Jeremiah 30:21 (ESV)

This prophecy raises a profound question: Who would dare approach the holy God? Under the Mosaic covenant, only the high priest could enter God's presence once a year in the Most Holy Place, and that with great fear (Leviticus 16). Yet Jeremiah foretells a Jewish leader who would have unique authorization to approach God directly.

## Fulfillment in Jesus

Jesus Christ serves as our great high priest who has opened the way for all believers to approach God:

> Since then we have a great **high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God**, let us hold fast our confession. For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin. **Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace**, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. — Hebrews 4:14-16 (ESV)

> Consequently, **he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them**. — Hebrews 7:25 (ESV)

Through Jesus' sacrificial death, the curtain separating humanity from God was torn, granting believers direct access:

> Therefore, brothers, since **we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus**, by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh, and since we have a great priest over the house of God, **let us draw near with a true heart** in full assurance of faith. — Hebrews 10:19-22 (ESV)

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **High priest role** (Hebrews 4:14): Jesus passed through heavens as high priest
- **Unique access** (Hebrews 10:19-22): Opens way for believers to approach God with confidence
- **Intercession** (Hebrews 7:25): Lives forever to intercede
- **Curtain torn** (Matthew 27:51): Barrier removed at Jesus' death
- **From among the people** (Hebrews 2:17): "He had to be made like his brothers in every respect"

Jesus is the leader who dared approach God—and through him, we too can approach the throne of grace with confidence.

## Jewish Perspective

### Messianic Status

**Not Considered Messianic.** Jeremiah 30:21 is generally not viewed by Jews as a messianic prophecy.

### Jewish Objections

1. **Historical context**: Jeremiah 30 describes Israel's restoration from Babylonian exile. "Their prince" refers to post-exilic Jewish leaders like Zerubbabel or the future restored Davidic monarchy in general, not a specific Messiah.

2. **Corporate leader, not high priest**: The verse describes a political "prince" and "ruler" from among the people—Jews don't see this as establishing a new priestly role. The high priest already had the right and duty to approach God; this verse doesn't describe something unique.

3. **Question is rhetorical**: "Who would dare of himself to approach me?" emphasizes that no one approaches God presumptuously—only those whom God authorizes. Under the Mosaic covenant, the high priest had this authorization. The verse isn't predicting a new kind of mediator.

4. **Already fulfilled**: Jews see this as fulfilled through the Levitical priesthood and prophetic leaders throughout Israel's history. There's no need for a future fulfillment through Jesus or anyone else.

## Christian Perspective

### Responses to Jewish Objections

#### 1. Greater Than High Priest

**Unique authorization**: While the high priest approached God annually with great fear and trembling, this prophecy describes a leader who "dares" to approach with confidence. Jesus provides this superior access.

**Permanent access**: The Levitical high priest's access was limited, temporary, and dangerous (many safeguards required). Jesus' access is permanent, complete, and opens the way for all believers to approach God with confidence.

#### 2. From Among the People

**Prince and priest combined**: Jeremiah describes a "prince" and "ruler"—suggesting both royal and priestly functions. Jesus fulfills both as king from David's line and priest after Melchizedek's order (Psalm 110:4; Hebrews 7:17).

**One of themselves**: Jesus was fully Jewish, born of Mary, from Judah's tribe—truly "one of themselves" yet uniquely authorized to approach God.

#### 3. Greater Fulfillment

**Restoration context**: While Jeremiah 30 addresses immediate restoration from exile, the chapter also contains clearly messianic elements (Jeremiah 30:9: "they shall serve the LORD their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them"). The leader who approaches God is part of this ultimate restoration.

**New covenant connection**: Jeremiah is the prophet who prophesied the new covenant (Jeremiah 31:31-34), immediately following this passage. The leader who approaches God is the mediator of this new covenant—Jesus.

## Assessment

**Christian View**: Jesus is the leader from among the people who dares approach God with unique authorization, serving as high priest who opens access to God's presence for all believers.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Debatable. The book of Hebrews extensively develops Jesus as the superior high priest who provides unprecedented access to God—this is substantial theological fulfillment. However, Jews legitimately question whether Jeremiah 30:21 was intended as messianic prophecy or described immediate post-exilic leadership. The interpretation depends on whether one reads Jeremiah 30-31 as containing both immediate (return from exile) and ultimate (messianic restoration) fulfillment, and whether the unique "daring to approach" suggests something beyond ordinary high priestly function.
