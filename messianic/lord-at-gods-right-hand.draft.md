# The Lord at God's Right Hand

> **Fulfillment Category:** Vague or Debatable
>
> This prophecy either lacks specific details or its original context makes messianic interpretation questionable. The visible subjugation of enemies remains incomplete, and the interpretation hinges on whether one accepts Messiah as divine (David's Lord), progressive enemy subjugation, Melchizedek priesthood as superior to Levitical system, and Jesus' resurrection establishing eternal priesthood.

## The Prophecy

Psalm 110 presents a startling image—David calling his own descendant "Lord":

> The LORD *(YHWH)* says to my Lord: **"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool**." The LORD sends forth from Zion your mighty scepter. Rule in the midst of your enemies! Your people will offer themselves freely on the day of your power, in holy garments; from the womb of the morning, the dew of your youth will be yours. The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind, **"You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."** — Psalm 110:1-4 (ESV)

This Messiah would:
- Sit at God's right hand (position of supreme authority)
- Rule over enemies
- Serve as *eternal priest* (combining king and priest roles)

The Melchizedek reference is significant—this priesthood predates and transcends the Levitical system.

## Fulfillment in Jesus

Jesus used this psalm to challenge the Pharisees' understanding:

> Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, saying, "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said to him, "The son of David." He said to them, "How is it then that David, in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying, **'The LORD (YHVH) said to my Lord, sit at My right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet'?** If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?" And no one was able to answer him a word. — Matthew 22:41-46 (ESV)

After his resurrection, Jesus ascended to this position:

> So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, **was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God**. — Mark 16:19 (ESV)

Peter testified:

> Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, **"The Lord said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.'"** — Acts 2:33-35 (ESV)

Regarding the eternal priesthood:

> So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by him who said to him, "You are my Son, today I have begotten you"; as he says also in another place, **"You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek."** — Hebrews 5:5-6 (ESV)

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Jesus' self-application** (Matthew 22:41-46): Used psalm to teach about Messiah's divine nature
- **Ascension** (Mark 16:19; Acts 1:9-11): Jesus ascended to God's right hand
- **Peter's testimony** (Acts 2:33-35): Applies psalm to Jesus' exaltation
- **Eternal priesthood** (Hebrews 5:6; 6:20; 7:17, 21): Jesus priest forever after Melchizedek's order
- **Current reign** (Ephesians 1:20-22; Colossians 3:1): Jesus currently seated at God's right hand

Jesus serves as both king (Davidic line) and eternal priest (Melchizedek order)—a unique combination.

## Jewish Perspective

### Messianic Status

**Debated Whether Messianic.** Psalm 110 presents interpretive challenges that divide Jewish scholars.

### Jewish Objections

1. **David speaking about himself**: Some argue David wrote this as a prophetic psalm about his own kingship, using third-person language poetically.

2. **David about Abraham**: A rabbinic interpretation (Midrash) suggests David is speaking about Abraham—"The LORD said to my lord [Abraham]"—referring to Genesis 14 where Melchizedek blessed Abraham.

3. **Military/political context**: The psalm emphasizes military conquest ("make your enemies your footstool," "shatter kings"), which Jews argue Jesus never fulfilled. The Messiah should achieve visible political victory.

4. **Melchizedek priesthood problematic**: Jews reject the concept of a non-Levitical priesthood for the Messiah. The Torah establishes the Aaronic/Levitical priesthood as eternal (Exodus 40:15; Numbers 25:13). Introducing a different priestly order contradicts the irrevocability of God's covenant with Aaron.

5. **"My Lord" explained differently**: Some Jewish interpretations say David is addressing his own descendants or speaking prophetically about the Messiah without implying deity—"my lord" (adoni) means "my master," a term of respect, not divinity (vs. Adonai, the divine name).

## Christian Perspective

### Responses to Jewish Objections

#### 1. Cannot Be David

**David didn't ascend**: Peter explicitly argues, "David did not ascend into the heavens" (Acts 2:34), therefore David couldn't be speaking about himself sitting at God's right hand.

**David calls him "Lord"**: Jesus' question to the Pharisees is devastating: if the Messiah is merely David's descendant, why would David call him "Lord"? (Matthew 22:43-45). A father doesn't call his son or descendant "lord" in Jewish culture—inferiors address superiors this way. This implies the Messiah is David's superior, not merely his descendant.

#### 2. Not Abraham

**Melchizedek blessed Abraham**: Genesis 14:18-20 records Melchizedek blessing Abraham, not the reverse. The greater blesses the lesser (Hebrews 7:7), so Melchizedek was superior to Abraham. Psalm 110 can't be about Abraham receiving Melchizedek's priesthood.

**Timing issue**: David lived centuries after Abraham—why would David address his ancestor as "my lord" in this context? The psalm clearly looks forward, not backward.

#### 3. Two-Stage Military Victory

**Spiritual victory accomplished**: Through death and resurrection, Jesus triumphed over sin, death, and Satan (Colossians 2:15; Hebrews 2:14-15). These are the ultimate enemies.

**Waiting for complete subjugation**: The psalm says "until I make your enemies your footstool"—the "until" indicates a waiting period. Currently Jesus sits at God's right hand while enemies are progressively subdued (1 Corinthians 15:25: "For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet").

**Future physical victory**: At the second coming, Jesus will return and visibly defeat all earthly opposition (Revelation 19:11-21).

#### 4. Melchizedek Priesthood Superior

**Pre-Mosaic priesthood**: Melchizedek's priesthood predates the Levitical system—it's more ancient and foundational (Hebrews 7:1-10). Genesis 14 shows Melchizedek as priest-king of Salem (Jerusalem), blessed by God Most High.

**Levitical system temporary**: The Levitical priesthood was "made according to a legal requirement concerning bodily descent" but Christ's priesthood is "by the power of an indestructible life" (Hebrews 7:16). The Law appointed mortal priests who died and needed replacement; Jesus' resurrection makes him eternal priest.

**Psalm 110 predicts change**: The very existence of Psalm 110:4 ("a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek") within Scripture proves God intended a priestly order beyond Aaron's line. If the Levitical priesthood were final and unchangeable, why would David prophesy about a different priestly order?

**Superiority demonstrated**: Hebrews 7:11-19 argues that if perfection could come through the Levitical priesthood, why would God prophesy another priest "after the order of Melchizedek"? The prophecy itself indicates the need for a better priesthood.

#### 5. "My Lord" Indicates Deity

**Hebrew distinction**: While "adoni" (my lord/master) can be used for humans, in the context of sitting at YHWH's right hand, ruling over all enemies, and serving as eternal priest, this "lord" transcends human authority.

**Right hand of God**: No mere human sits at God's right hand. This position indicates divine status and authority. Stephen's vision confirmed this: "I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God" (Acts 7:56).

**Jesus' interpretation**: Jesus used this psalm to teach that the Messiah is more than David's son—he is David's Lord, implying divine nature (Matthew 22:41-46).

## Assessment

**Christian View**: Jesus is the Lord at God's right hand, fulfilling Psalm 110 as the divine Messiah who is both king and eternal priest. His ascension, current session at God's right hand, and role as Melchizedek priest demonstrate fulfillment.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Possibly. The evidence is substantial: Jesus' use of the psalm to teach about Messiah's nature, multiple apostolic testimonies of ascension and session at God's right hand, and the unique priest-king combination. However, the visible subjugation of enemies remains incomplete (requiring eschatological fulfillment), and the non-Levitical priesthood is controversial from a Jewish perspective. The interpretation hinges on whether one accepts:
- Messiah as divine (David's Lord, not just descendant)
- Progressive enemy subjugation (spiritual victory now, physical later)
- Melchizedek priesthood as superior to and replacement of Levitical system
- Jesus' resurrection establishing eternal priesthood
