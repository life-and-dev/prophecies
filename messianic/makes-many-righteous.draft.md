> **Fulfillment Category:** Complete Fulfillment
>
> This prophecy contains specific, verifiable details that were demonstrably fulfilled in Jesus' documented life. The evidence includes Jesus himself quoting Isaiah 53:12, his crucifixion between criminals as "numbered with the transgressors," and the development of justification theology throughout the New Testament.

## The Prophecy

> Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied; by his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, **make many to be accounted righteous**, and he shall bear their iniquities. Therefore I will divide him a portion with the many, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong, because he poured out his soul to death and **was numbered with the transgressors**; yet **he bore the sin of many, and makes intercession for the transgressors**. — Isaiah 53:11-12 (ESV)

The Servant *makes many righteous* through bearing their sins. Counted among criminals yet interceding for sinners.

## Fulfillment in Jesus

Jesus himself cited this prophecy:

> For I tell you that this Scripture must be fulfilled in me: **"And he was numbered with the transgressors."** For what is written about me has its fulfillment. — Luke 22:37 (ESV)

And it happened—crucified between criminals:

> And with him they crucified **two robbers, one on his right and one on his left**. — Mark 15:27 (ESV)

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Jesus cited it** (Luke 22:37): Explicitly claimed this prophecy
- **Crucified with criminals** (Mark 15:27): Numbered with transgressors
- **Makes many righteous** (Romans 5:19): "By the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous"
- **Bore sins** (1 Peter 2:24): "He himself bore our sins in his body"
- **Intercedes** (Romans 8:34; Hebrews 7:25): Jesus intercedes for believers

## Jewish Perspective

*See "Jewish Perspective on Isaiah 52-53 (Overview)".*

## Christian Perspective

### Response

Jesus' self-application of this prophecy (Luke 22:37) is significant—he consciously fulfilled it. The New Testament consistently teaches that through Jesus' death, many are made righteous (justified) before God, exactly as Isaiah prophesied.

## Assessment

**Christian View**: Jesus bore the sins of many, was numbered with transgressors at crucifixion, and makes many righteous through his atoning work. He continues to intercede for believers.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Yes. Jesus explicitly claimed this prophecy and it was fulfilled at crucifixion. The New Testament theology of justification (being made righteous through Christ's atoning death) directly matches Isaiah 53:11-12's language.
