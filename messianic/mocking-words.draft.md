# Mocking Words

## The Prophecy

> All who see me mock me; they make mouths at me; they wag their heads; **"He trusts in the LORD; let him deliver him; let him rescue him, for he delights in him!"** — Psalm 22:7-8 (ESV)

## Fulfillment in Jesus

> And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, "You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross." So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, "He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. **He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him**. For he said, 'I am the Son of God.'" — Matthew 27:39-43 (ESV)

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Verbatim quote** (Matthew 27:43): Mockers unknowingly quoted Psalm 22:8 word-for-word
- **Wagging heads** (Matthew 27:39): Exactly as Psalm 22:7 describes
- **Mocking** (Matthew 27:39-43): Derided and mocked

The mockers unknowingly quoted Psalm 22 verbatim.

## Jewish Perspective

*See "Jewish Perspective on Psalm 22 (Overview)"—lament psalm, not prophecy.*

## Christian Perspective

### Response

The remarkable detail is that the mockers quoted Psalm 22:8 almost verbatim without realizing they were fulfilling prophecy. This wasn't something Jesus could control or fabricate—the mockers' spontaneous words matched David's psalm.

## Assessment

**Christian View**: The mockers at Jesus' crucifixion unknowingly quoted Psalm 22:8, fulfilling the prophecy.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Yes. The verbatim quote by the mockers is striking. This wasn't orchestrated by Jesus—his opponents spontaneously spoke words written 1000 years earlier, matching Psalm 22:8 almost exactly.
