# Money Thrown in Temple, Used for Potter's Field

## The Prophecy

> Then the LORD said to me, "**Throw it to the potter**"—the lordly price at which I was priced by them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and **threw them into the house of the LORD, to the potter**. — Zechariah 11:13 (ESV)

## Fulfillment in Jesus

> Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he changed his mind and **brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests** and the elders, saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood." They said, "What is that to us? See to it yourself." And **throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple**, he departed, and he went and hanged himself. But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, "It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money." So they took counsel and **bought with them the potter's field** as a burial place for strangers. — Matthew 27:3-7 (ESV)

Thirty silver pieces, thrown into the temple, used to buy a potter's field—precisely as Zechariah wrote.

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Thrown in temple** (Matthew 27:5): Judas threw silver into temple
- **Potter's field** (Matthew 27:7): Money used to buy potter's field
- **Exact sequence**: Same order—thirty silver, temple, potter
- **Matthew's citation** (Matthew 27:9-10): Links to Jeremiah/Zechariah

## Jewish Perspective

*See previous prophecy—not considered messianic; symbolic action in Zechariah's time.*

## Christian Perspective

### Response

The sequence of details is too specific to dismiss as coincidence: (1) thirty pieces of silver, (2) thrown into the temple, (3) used for potter's field. Zechariah couldn't have fabricated this based on later events since he wrote 500 years before Jesus.

## Assessment

**Christian View**: The precise fulfillment of multiple specific details (amount, location, use) demonstrates prophetic intent.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Possibly. The multiple specific details matching in exact sequence is remarkable. However, whether Zechariah intended this as messianic prophecy remains debated.
