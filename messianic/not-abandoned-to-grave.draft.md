# Not Abandoned to the Grave

> **Fulfillment Category:** Complete Fulfillment
>
> This prophecy contains specific, verifiable details that were demonstrably fulfilled in Jesus' documented life. The evidence includes the third-day resurrection before bodily decomposition could occur, along with Peter's apostolic argument in Acts 2:27-31 explicitly applying this psalm to Jesus' resurrection.

## The Prophecy

David wrote prophetically:

> For you will not abandon my soul to Sheol, **or let your holy one see corruption**. You make known to me the path of life; in your presence there is fullness of joy; at your right hand are pleasures forevermore. — Psalm 16:10-11 (ESV)

The Holy One would not experience bodily decay—implying resurrection before decomposition.

## Fulfillment in Jesus

The apostle Peter preached at Pentecost:

> Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, **he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ**, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. **This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses**. — Acts 2:29-32 (ESV)

Jesus rose from the dead before his body could decay—fulfilling David's prophecy.

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Peter's testimony** (Acts 2:29-32): Applies Psalm 16:10 to Jesus' resurrection
- **Paul's sermon** (Acts 13:35-37): Also cites this psalm for Jesus
- **Third day resurrection** (Matthew 28:1-6): Rose before decomposition
- **Witnesses** (Acts 2:32): Apostles testified to resurrection

## Jewish Perspective

### Messianic Status

**Not Considered Messianic.**

### Jewish Objections

1. **David speaking about himself**: The entire psalm is first-person ("my," "me," "I")—David expressing confidence God will protect him from death during his lifetime.

2. **Sheol doesn't mean hell**: In Hebrew thought, Sheol is the grave or realm of the dead—everyone goes there. "Not abandon to Sheol" means "preserve from death" or "rescue from dying," not "resurrect after death."

3. **"See corruption" means "experience death"**: The phrase means "don't let me die" or "protect me from decay while alive"—a prayer for protection from premature death, not prediction of resurrection.

4. **David's confidence fulfilled**: God did protect David from many dangers. The psalm was fulfilled in David's own experience.

5. **No resurrection expectation**: Jewish theology during David's time didn't have developed resurrection doctrine. That came later (Daniel 12:2). David wasn't prophesying about resurrection.

6. **Peter's interpretation creative**: Peter's argument that "David died and was buried" proves he wasn't speaking about himself doesn't account for the fact that David was expressing confidence God would preserve him from death—which God did during David's lifetime.

## Christian Perspective

### Response

**Peter's argument**: Peter explicitly argues David couldn't be speaking about himself because David died and his tomb remained. Therefore, David spoke prophetically about Messiah (Acts 2:29-31).

**"See corruption" implies resurrection**: The phrase "not... see corruption" suggests the body won't decompose, which requires resurrection before decay sets in. Jesus rose on the third day before decomposition began.

**Resurrection necessary**: If the prophecy only meant protection during life, why say "not see corruption"? This language implies death followed by resurrection before bodily decay.

**Apostolic interpretation**: Both Peter (Acts 2:25-32) and Paul (Acts 13:35-37) independently apply this to Jesus' resurrection under Holy Spirit inspiration.

## Assessment

**Christian View**: David prophetically spoke of Messiah's resurrection, which was fulfilled when Jesus rose from the dead on the third day before his body experienced decomposition.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Possibly. Peter's apostolic testimony and argument are compelling—David died, so couldn't be speaking about himself. Jesus did rise before decomposition (third day). However, whether Psalm 16:10 was originally prophetic about resurrection or David's prayer for protection during life is disputed. The interpretation depends on whether "not see corruption" requires resurrection or simply means preservation from death.
