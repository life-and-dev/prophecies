# Pierced for Our Transgressions

> **Fulfillment Category:** Complete Fulfillment
>
> This prophecy contains specific, verifiable details that were demonstrably fulfilled in Jesus' documented life. The evidence includes the literal piercing of Jesus on the cross (nails and spear) and the development of vicarious atonement theology in early Christianity based on his sacrificial death.

## The Prophecy

> But **he was pierced for our transgressions; he was crushed for our iniquities**; upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and **with his wounds we are healed**. All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned—every one—to his own way; and **the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all**. — Isaiah 53:5-6 (ESV)

**Vicarious atonement**—he suffers *for* our sins, not his own. His wounds bring *our* healing.

## Fulfillment in Jesus

Jesus was literally pierced—nails through hands and feet, spear through side:

> Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here, and see **my hands**; and put out your hand, and place it in **my side**. Do not disbelieve, but believe." — John 20:27 (ESV)

> But one of the soldiers **pierced his side with a spear**, and at once there came out blood and water. — John 19:34 (ESV)

Paul explained the vicarious nature:

> For our sake he [God] made him [Jesus] **to be sin who knew no sin**, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God. — 2 Corinthians 5:21 (ESV)

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Literal piercing** (John 19:34; 20:27): Nails, spear wounds
- **For our sins** (1 Peter 2:24): "He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree"
- **Substitutionary** (2 Corinthians 5:21): Made sin for us though sinless
- **Brings peace** (Romans 5:1): "We have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ"
- **Healing** (1 Peter 2:24): "By his wounds you have been healed"

## Jewish Perspective

*See "Jewish Perspective on Isaiah 52-53 (Overview)"—servant is Israel bearing nations' sins metaphorically.*

## Christian Perspective

### Response

The literal piercing (crucifixion) combined with the New Testament's consistent teaching of substitutionary atonement demonstrates fulfillment. Jesus died in our place, bearing our sins, bringing peace and healing through his wounds.

## Assessment

**Christian View**: Jesus was literally pierced and died as a substitutionary sacrifice for humanity's sins, fulfilling Isaiah's prophecy precisely.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Yes. The literal piercing is historically documented (Roman crucifixion). The New Testament consistently teaches vicarious atonement, matching Isaiah 53:5-6's language of bearing others' iniquities. The concept of substitutionary sacrifice fits both the prophecy and Jesus' death.
