# Pierced Hands and Feet

## The Prophecy

> For dogs encompass me; a company of evildoers encircles me; **they have pierced my hands and feet**—I can count all my bones—they stare and gloat over me. — Psalm 22:16-17 (ESV)

"Pierced my hands and feet" describes crucifixion—a Roman execution method not invented when David wrote this (~1000 BC).

## Fulfillment in Jesus

Crucifixion involved nails through hands and feet. After resurrection, Jesus showed the wounds:

> Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here, and see **my hands**; and put out your hand, and place it in my side. Do not disbelieve, but believe." — John 20:27 (ESV)

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Nail wounds** (John 20:25-27): Thomas saw and touched the wounds
- **Hands and feet pierced** (Luke 24:39-40): Jesus showed hands and feet to disciples
- **Crucifixion method**: Roman execution pierced hands and feet with nails

Thomas could see and touch the nail wounds in Jesus' hands.

## Jewish Perspective

*See "Jewish Perspective on Psalm 22 (Overview)"—Hebrew text disputed ("like a lion" vs. "pierced"), lament psalm not prophecy.*

### Jewish Objection on Text

The Hebrew text is disputed. The Masoretic Text reads "ka'ari" (כָּאֲרִי) meaning "like a lion [at my hands and feet]," not "pierced" (which would be "karu" - כָּרוּ). Jews argue Christians rely on the Septuagint mistranslation.

## Christian Perspective

### Response

**Septuagint translation**: The Septuagint (translated by Jewish scholars ~250 BC, before Christianity) rendered it "pierced," suggesting ancient Jewish understanding supported this reading.

**Context favors piercing**: "Like a lion my hands and feet" is grammatically awkward. The context describes suffering inflicted by enemies, making "pierced" more coherent.

**Dead Sea Scrolls**: Some Dead Sea Scroll fragments support the "pierced" reading.

**Crucifixion detail**: David couldn't have known about crucifixion (invented by Romans centuries later), yet the description fits perfectly.

## Assessment

**Christian View**: David prophetically described crucifixion—hands and feet pierced—which Jesus experienced.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Possibly. The textual debate ("pierced" vs. "like a lion") creates uncertainty. However, ancient translations (Septuagint) support "pierced," and the description remarkably matches crucifixion details David couldn't have witnessed. The interpretation depends on textual criticism and whether Psalm 22 is prophetic.
