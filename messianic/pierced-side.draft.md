# Pierced Side

## The Prophecy

Zechariah saw a future mourning over one who was pierced:

> And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of compassion and supplication, so that, **when they look on him whom they have pierced, they shall mourn for him**, as one mourns for an only child, and weep bitterly over him, as one weeps over a firstborn. — Zechariah 12:10 (ESV)

## Fulfillment in Jesus

> But one of the soldiers **pierced his side with a spear**, and at once there came out blood and water. He who saw it has borne witness—his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth—that you also may believe. For these things took place that the Scripture might be fulfilled: "Not one of his bones will be broken." And again another Scripture says, **"They will look on him whom they have pierced."** — John 19:34-37 (ESV)

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Literal piercing** (John 19:34): Spear through Jesus' side
- **John's eyewitness** (John 19:35): Testifies to seeing it personally
- **John's citation** (John 19:37): Explicitly cites Zechariah 12:10
- **Future mourning**: Revelation 1:7 applies this to second coming

## Jewish Perspective

### Messianic Status

**Debated Whether Messianic.**

### Jewish Objections

1. **Context: military victory**: Zechariah 12 describes Jerusalem's future deliverance when God defeats attacking nations. The "piercing" occurs in warfare context—Jews interpret this as a Jewish military leader or martyr killed in battle defending Jerusalem.

2. **"Me whom they have pierced" vs. "him"**: Hebrew text ambiguous—could mean God speaking (how can God be pierced?), or "him whom they have pierced" referring to a human. Some translations read "they shall look to me concerning him whom they pierced."

3. **National mourning, not individual**: The mourning involves "every family by itself" (12:12-14), depicting national lamentation over Jewish casualties in end-times battles.

4. **Piercing is warfare, not crucifixion**: Hebrew "daqar" means pierce/thrust through with sword or spear in battle—describes military death, not crucifixion. The Roman soldier's spear thrust doesn't fit Zechariah 12's eschatological battle context.

## Christian Perspective

### Response

**John's interpretation authoritative**: John, an eyewitness apostle, explicitly applies this to Jesus (John 19:37). His inspired interpretation reveals the prophecy's meaning.

**Literal fulfillment**: Jesus was literally pierced with a spear. The physical act matches the prophecy.

**Future mourning**: Revelation 1:7 ("every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him") applies Zechariah 12:10 to Jesus' second coming, when Israel will mourn recognizing their Messiah.

**Dual reference**: The prophecy may have dual application—immediate context (warfare) and ultimate fulfillment (Messiah's piercing and recognition).

## Assessment

**Christian View**: Jesus was literally pierced at crucifixion, fulfilling Zechariah 12:10. The mourning described will occur when Israel recognizes Jesus as Messiah at his return.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Possibly. The literal piercing is documented. John's apostolic testimony applies it to Jesus. However, whether Zechariah 12:10 was originally messianic or about end-times warfare is disputed. The interpretation depends on textual variants ("me" vs. "him") and contextual understanding (individual Messiah vs. collective Israel).
