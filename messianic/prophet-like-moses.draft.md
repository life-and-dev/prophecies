# The Prophet Like Moses

> **Fulfillment Category:** Complete Fulfillment
>
> This prophecy contains specific, verifiable details that were demonstrably fulfilled in Jesus' documented life. The evidence includes miraculous provision of food like Moses' manna and covenant mediation establishing reconciliation, along with first-century recognition by crowds who witnessed the feeding miracle.

## The Prophecy

Moses, the great lawgiver, predicted a future prophet who would surpass even his own authority:

> "The LORD your God will raise up for you **a prophet like me from among you**, from your brothers—it is to him you shall listen— **just as you desired of the LORD your God at Horeb on the day of the assembly**, when you said, 'Let me not hear again the voice of the LORD my God or see this great fire any more, lest I die.' And the LORD said to me, 'They are right in what they have spoken. **I will raise up for them a prophet like you from among their brothers**. And **I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him**. And whoever will not listen to my words that he shall speak in my name, I myself will require it of him. — Deuteronomy 18:15-19 (ESV)

The prophecy emphasizes that this prophet would be a unique **prophet-mediator like Moses**—one who both **speaks God's words** ("I will put my words in his mouth") and **stands as covenant intermediary** between God and the people. This refers to what happened at Mount Horeb: when Israel heard God's terrifying voice directly, they asked Moses to mediate—to stand between them and God, receiving God's words and conveying them to the people. God approved this arrangement, making Moses the covenant mediator through whom He would communicate.

Moses' role was unique. While there were many prophets after Moses who spoke God's words, none functioned as a prophet-mediator in the way Moses did:

1. None stood as covenant mediator between God and Israel, establishing covenant relationship
2. None gave covenant laws with provisions for atonement and reconciliation
3. None miraculously provided food for Israel like Moses did with manna

Biblical mediation involves both **communication** (speaking God's words as intermediary) and **reconciliation** (establishing covenant, turning people from sin). Moses performed both functions, making him more than just a prophet.

## Fulfillment in Jesus

### The Crowd Recognizes the Sign

After Jesus miraculously fed 5,000 people, the crowd immediately recognized him as the prophet Moses foretold, focusing on the miraculous sign—a prophet who could provide food like Moses provided manna:

> Jesus then took the loaves, and when he had given thanks, he distributed them to those who were seated. So also the fish, as much as they wanted. And when they had eaten their fill, he told his disciples, "Gather up the leftover fragments, that nothing may be lost."
>
> So they gathered them up and filled twelve baskets with fragments from the five barley loaves left by those who had eaten.
>
> **When the people saw the sign** that he had done, they said, **"This is indeed the Prophet who is to come into the world!"**
>
> Perceiving then that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, Jesus withdrew again to the mountain by himself. — John 6:11-15 (ESV)

The crowd's response shows they recognized that Jesus could provide food like Moses provided manna.

### Peter Emphasizes the Purpose

Peter explicitly identified Jesus as the prophet Moses foretold, emphasizing the purpose of the prophet-mediator role—**reconciling humanity to God**:

> For Moses truly said to the fathers,
>
>> 'The LORD your God will raise up for you **a prophet like me** from your brethren. Him you shall hear in all things, whatever he says to you. And it shall be that every soul who will not hear that prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.'...
>
> To you first, God, having **raised up his servant Jesus, sent him** to bless you, in **turning away every one of you from your iniquities**. — Acts 3:22-26 (NKJV)

Peter's interpretation focuses on the reconciliation aspect of mediation: "turning away from your iniquities" and "blessing you." This is the covenant mediator's ultimate purpose—not merely to perform signs or deliver messages, but to establish peace between God and humanity by resolving sin. Peter understood the prophetic purpose was to establish a covenant of reconciliation like Moses establishing the Mosaic Covenant.

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Miraculous provision** (John 6:11-15): Fed 5,000; crowd recognized him as "the Prophet"
- **Peter's identification** (Acts 3:22-26): Explicitly applies Deuteronomy 18:15 to Jesus
- **Covenant mediator** (Hebrews 8:6; 9:15; 12:24): Jesus mediator of new covenant
- **God's words spoken** (John 8:28; 12:49-50): Jesus speaks what the Father commands
- **Reconciliation accomplished** (2 Corinthians 5:18-19): Through Jesus, God reconciles world to Himself

## Jewish Perspective

### Messianic Status

**Debated Whether Messianic.** Deuteronomy 18:15-19 is interpreted in multiple ways within Jewish tradition.

### Jewish Objections

1. **Continuous fulfillment**: Many Jewish scholars argue this refers to the entire line of prophets throughout Israel's history, not one specific individual. Each authentic prophet was "like Moses" in speaking God's words. The prophecy establishes the office of prophet generally, not one future individual.

2. **The Messiah as political leader**: Some rabbinic sources do apply this to the Messiah, but emphasize the Messiah will be "like Moses" in leading Israel to political freedom from oppression and establishing God's law throughout the earth, which Jesus did not do.

3. **Criteria not met**: Jews argue Jesus doesn't match Moses' role—Moses gave the Torah which remains eternal and unchangeable (Deuteronomy 4:2; 13:1-5), whereas Christians claim Jesus brought a "new covenant" superseding Mosaic law. This contradicts the "like Moses" comparison since Moses' law was meant to be permanent.

4. **False prophet test**: Deuteronomy 13:1-5 warns against prophets who perform signs but lead Israel away from Torah observance. Jews claim Jesus fits this description by advocating for setting aside dietary laws, Sabbath restrictions, and temple sacrifice—leading people away from God's commands through Moses.

## Christian Perspective

### Responses to Jewish Objections

#### 1. Singular Prophet, Not Continuous Line

**Grammatical evidence**: The Hebrew text uses singular forms ("a prophet," "him") rather than plural, suggesting one specific individual (Deuteronomy 18:15, 19).

**First-century expectation**: First-century Jews expected "the Prophet" as a distinct figure (John 1:21, 6:14, 7:40), separate from "the Christ" and "Elijah." This shows Jewish understanding of a singular prophetic figure.

**Dead Sea Scrolls**: The Dead Sea Scrolls (4Q175, c. 100 BCE) list a singular "prophet like Moses" as an expected messianic figure, demonstrating pre-Christian Jewish expectation of one specific prophet.

**Deuteronomy 34:10**: "No prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face"—this emphasizes Moses' unique status that no subsequent prophet matched until Jesus came. If the prophecy meant all prophets generally, this statement would be false since many prophets arose after Moses.

#### 2. Spiritual Freedom Precedes Political Kingdom

**Moses' primary role**: Moses' primary role was covenant mediator, not merely political liberator. Exodus 7:16 emphasizes serving God ("Let my people go, that they may serve me"), not just political freedom.

**Two comings**: The Old Testament prophecies describe two comings of Messiah: first for spiritual redemption (Isaiah 53—suffering servant) and second for political kingdom (Isaiah 11:1-10). Jesus fulfilled the first coming by delivering humanity from spiritual bondage to sin (John 8:36, 18:36), with the visible messianic kingdom awaiting the Second Coming.

**Greater liberation**: Jesus liberates from sin and death—more fundamental than political oppression. Physical freedom without spiritual freedom leaves humanity enslaved to sin.

#### 3. Fulfillment, Not Abolition

**Jeremiah's new covenant**: Jeremiah 31:31-34 shows God Himself promises a "new covenant... not like the covenant" made at Sinai, with the law written on hearts rather than stone tablets. This new covenant was prophesied within the Old Testament itself.

**Jesus fulfills, not abolishes**: Jesus claimed to "fulfill" the Torah, not "abolish" it (Matthew 5:17-20). Christians distinguish between:
- **Moral law**: Eternal principles like love God and neighbor, which Jesus intensified (Matthew 5:21-48)
- **Ceremonial law**: Sacrifices and priesthood which were "shadows" pointing to Christ and fulfilled by His work (Colossians 2:16-17, Hebrews 10:1-18)

**Deuteronomy 4:2 properly understood**: This prohibits human additions to the original Torah, not divine progressive revelation through prophets. Like Moses who brought covenant terms from God, Jesus as prophet-mediator brought new covenant terms as Jeremiah predicted.

#### 4. The Test Is Idolatry, Not Ceremonial Law

**Deuteronomy 13 tests idolatry**: Deuteronomy 13:1-5 tests whether a prophet leads people to worship "other gods," not whether ceremonial practices change.

**Jesus affirmed monotheism**: Jesus consistently affirmed monotheism (Mark 12:29, quoting Deuteronomy 6:4: "Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one") and never led people away from the God of Israel.

**Traditions vs. Torah**: Jesus challenged Pharisaic hand-washing traditions (human additions, not Torah itself, Mark 7:1-13). He performed works of necessity and mercy on Sabbath while regularly attending synagogue (Luke 4:16, Matthew 12:1-14).

**Higher standard**: Far from lowering Torah's standards, Jesus intensified moral requirements—declaring anger equivalent to murder and lust to adultery (Matthew 5:21-48).

**No sin proven**: The Pharisees could never prove Jesus broke God's law (John 8:46: "Which one of you convicts me of sin?") and resorted to false witnesses at His trial (Matthew 26:59-60).

## Assessment

**Christian View**: Jesus is the prophet like Moses whom God raised up—a covenant mediator who speaks God's words, provides miraculous sustenance, and establishes a new covenant that reconciles humanity to God. Peter's apostolic testimony, the crowd's recognition after the feeding miracle, and Jesus' role as mediator confirm fulfillment.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Yes. The evidence is strong across multiple dimensions:
- **Miraculous provision** like manna demonstrates parallel to Moses
- **Covenant mediation** establishing reconciliation fulfills the deeper purpose
- **First-century Jewish recognition** that "the Prophet" was a distinct expected figure
- **Apostolic testimony** from Peter explicitly identifies Jesus as this prophet

The objections center on whether the new covenant supersedes or fulfills the old, and whether Jesus led people away from God (Jews say yes; Christians say no, pointing to his affirmation of monotheism and moral law). The interpretation depends on whether one accepts Jesus' authority to establish a new covenant as prophesied by Jeremiah, and whether intensifying moral standards while fulfilling ceremonial shadows constitutes continuity or contradiction with Moses' role.
