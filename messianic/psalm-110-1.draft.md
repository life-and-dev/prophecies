# Psalm 110: A Messianic Interpretation

## Introduction

Psalm 110 contains a remarkable prophecy in which the LORD bestows immense authority upon a figure David refers to as "my Lord." This individual is invited to sit at God's right hand, wielding a scepter of power and holding an eternal priesthood in the order of Melchizedek. This passage has been the subject of intense theological debate for centuries, with Jewish and Christian scholars offering vastly different interpretations of its meaning and fulfillment. This article will explore the prophecy, its historical context, and the primary arguments from both perspectives.

## The Prophecy of Psalm 110

> The LORD says to my Lord: **"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool."** The LORD sends forth from Zion your mighty scepter. Rule in the midst of your enemies! Your people will offer themselves freely on the day of your power, in holy garments; from the womb of the morning, the dew of your youth will be yours. The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind, **"You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."** — Psalm 110:1-4 (ESV)

## Interpretations

### Jewish Perspective

Jewish interpretations of Psalm 110 are diverse, with no single consensus on its meaning. The psalm's messianic nature is a subject of debate among scholars, leading to several main viewpoints:

1.  **David's Royal Psalm:** Some scholars suggest that David composed this psalm for a royal occasion, possibly his coronation, referring to himself in the third person. In this view, the psalm is a poetic expression of David's own kingship and his relationship with God, rather than a prophecy about a future messianic figure.

2.  **A Prophecy about Abraham:** Another interpretation, found in rabbinic literature (Midrash), posits that David is speaking of his ancestor, Abraham. In this view, the phrase "The LORD said to my lord" refers to God's promise to Abraham after his victorious return from battle, as described in Genesis 14, where he is blessed by Melchizedek.

3.  **Future Davidic King:** Many Jewish scholars view the psalm as a prophecy about a future king from the Davidic line. However, this king is not necessarily divine. The term *adoni* ("my lord") is a common honorific for a human superior and does not imply divinity.

4.  **Unfulfilled Military Conquest:** A significant challenge for messianic interpretations is the psalm's emphasis on military victory ("make your enemies your footstool," "shatter kings"). Since Jesus did not achieve a political or military conquest of Israel's enemies, many Jewish scholars argue that He could not be the fulfillment of this prophecy.

5.  **The Melchizedek Priesthood:** The concept of a non-Levitical priesthood for the Messiah is problematic in Jewish tradition. The Torah establishes the Aaronic priesthood as an eternal covenant (Exodus 40:15; Numbers 25:13), and the idea of a different priestly order is seen as a contradiction.

### Christian Perspective

Christians universally see Psalm 110 as a direct prophecy about Jesus Christ, His divinity, and His role as both King and High Priest. This interpretation is foundational to New Testament theology:

1.  **Jesus' Own Testimony:** Jesus quoted this psalm to challenge the Pharisees' understanding of the Messiah (Matthew 22:41-46). By asking why David would call his own son "Lord," Jesus pointed to the Messiah's divine nature, suggesting He was more than just a human descendant.

2.  **Apostolic Witness:** The apostles frequently cited this psalm as evidence of Jesus's resurrection and ascension. Peter, in his Pentecost sermon (Acts 2:33-35), declared that David "did not ascend into the heavens" but was prophesying about Jesus, who was "exalted at the right hand of God."

3.  **The Ascension:** The Gospels record Jesus's ascension into heaven, where He "sat down at the right hand of God" (Mark 16:19), a direct fulfillment of the psalm's opening verse.

4.  **Progressive Fulfillment:** Christians address the issue of unfulfilled military conquest through the concept of progressive fulfillment. They believe that Jesus's death and resurrection achieved a spiritual victory over sin and death, and He currently reigns at God's right hand until His Second Coming, when He will achieve a final physical victory over all enemies (1 Corinthians 15:25).

5.  **A Superior Priesthood:** The author of Hebrews argues that the Melchizedek priesthood is superior to the Levitical priesthood because it is eternal and not based on lineage (Hebrews 7). Jesus, as an eternal High Priest in the order of Melchizedek, provides a better covenant and a perfect, once-for-all sacrifice for sins.

## Conclusion

Psalm 110 remains a pivotal and contentious passage in biblical interpretation.

-   **Jewish scholars** offer various interpretations, with some viewing it as a royal psalm for David, a reference to Abraham, or a prophecy about a future, non-divine Davidic king. Key objections to a Christian interpretation include the [unfulfilled military conquest](#jewish-perspective) and the contradiction of a [non-Levitical priesthood](#jewish-perspective).

-   **Christians** see the psalm as a clear and direct prophecy of Jesus Christ, pointing to His [divinity, ascension, and dual role as King and High Priest](#christian-perspective). The New Testament's frequent citation of this psalm demonstrates its importance in early Christian theology, with the concept of [progressive fulfillment](#christian-perspective) addressing the as-yet-unseen complete victory.

Ultimately, one's interpretation of Psalm 110 hinges on foundational theological commitments, particularly concerning the nature of the Messiah and the relationship between the Old and New Testaments.
