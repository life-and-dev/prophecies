# Sit at My Right Hand

## The Prophecy

> The LORD says to my Lord: **"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool."** The LORD sends forth from Zion your mighty scepter. Rule in the midst of your enemies! Your people will offer themselves freely on the day of your power, in holy garments; from the womb of the morning, the dew of your youth will be yours. The LORD has sworn and will not change his mind, **"You are a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek."** — Psalm 110:1-4 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Tanakh

No Old Testament author explicitly quotes this psalm as fulfilled messianic prophecy, though it was recognized as significant within the Davidic royal tradition.

### Apostles

Jesus used this psalm to challenge the Pharisees' understanding of the Messiah:

> Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, saying, "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?" They said to him, "The son of David." He said to them, "How is it then that David, in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying, **'The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet"'?** If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?" And no one was able to answer him a word. — Matthew 22:41-46 (ESV)

After His resurrection, Jesus ascended to this position:

> So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, **was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God**. — Mark 16:19 (ESV)

Peter testified at Pentecost:

> Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, **"The LORD said to my Lord, 'Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.'"** — Acts 2:33-35 (ESV)

Regarding the eternal priesthood after Melchizedek's order:

> So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by him who said to him, "You are my Son, today I have begotten you"; as he says also in another place, **"You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek."** — Hebrews 5:5-6 (ESV)

### Christian

Christians believe Jesus fulfilled this prophecy through His ascension and current session at God's right hand, arguing that:

**Multiple Apostolic Witnesses:**
- Jesus' self-application (Matthew 22:41-46): Used the psalm to teach about the Messiah's divine nature
- Ascension witnessed (Mark 16:19; Acts 1:9-11): Many disciples witnessed Jesus ascend to heaven
- Peter's public testimony (Acts 2:33-35): Applied the psalm to Jesus' exaltation in front of thousands, including hostile religious leaders
- Current position affirmed (Ephesians 1:20-22; Colossians 3:1): Jesus currently seated at God's right hand
- Intercession role (Romans 8:34): Christ intercedes for believers at God's right hand

**Unique Priest-King Combination:**
- Jesus serves as both king (Davidic line) and eternal priest (Melchizedek order)
- Eternal priesthood (Hebrews 5:6, 6:20, 7:17,21): Jesus is priest forever after Melchizedek's order

**Responses to Objections:**

1. **Cannot Be David:** Peter explicitly argues, "David did not ascend into the heavens" (Acts 2:34), therefore David could not be speaking about himself sitting at God's right hand. Additionally, Jesus' question to the Pharisees is compelling: if the Messiah is merely David's descendant, why would David call him "Lord"? (Matthew 22:43-45). In Jewish culture, inferiors address superiors this way, not fathers addressing descendants. This implies the Messiah is David's superior, indicating divine nature.

2. **Not Abraham:** Some rabbinic interpretations suggest David spoke about Abraham, but this fails because Melchizedek blessed Abraham (Genesis 14:18-20), not vice versa. The greater blesses the lesser (Hebrews 7:7), so Melchizedek was superior to Abraham. The psalm cannot refer to Abraham receiving Melchizedek's priesthood. Additionally, David lived centuries after Abraham—the psalm clearly looks forward, not backward.

3. **Two-Stage Military Victory:** Christians argue for progressive fulfillment. Spiritual victory was accomplished through Jesus' death and resurrection, triumphing over sin, death, and Satan (Colossians 2:15; Hebrews 2:14-15). The word "until" indicates a waiting period—Jesus currently sits at God's right hand while enemies are progressively subdued (1 Corinthians 15:25). Complete physical victory will occur at the Second Coming (Revelation 19:11-21).

4. **Melchizedek Priesthood Superior to Levitical:** Melchizedek's priesthood predates the Levitical system, making it more ancient and foundational (Hebrews 7:1-10). Genesis 14 shows Melchizedek as priest-king blessed by God Most High. The Levitical system was "made according to a legal requirement concerning bodily descent," but Christ's priesthood operates "by the power of an indestructible life" (Hebrews 7:16). The very existence of Psalm 110:4 within Scripture proves God intended a priestly order beyond Aaron's line. Hebrews 7:11-19 argues that if perfection could come through the Levitical priesthood, God would not prophesy another priest "after the order of Melchizedek."

5. **"My Lord" Indicates Deity:** While the Hebrew *adoni* (my lord/master) can be used for humans, in the context of sitting at YHWH's right hand, ruling over all enemies, and serving as eternal priest, this "lord" transcends human authority. No mere human sits at God's right hand—this position indicates divine status. Stephen's vision confirmed this: "I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God" (Acts 7:56).

### Jews

Jewish scholars are divided on whether Psalm 110 is messianic, presenting several interpretative challenges:

1. **David Speaking About Himself:** Some argue David wrote this as a prophetic psalm about his own kingship, using third-person language poetically.

2. **David About Abraham:** A rabbinic interpretation (Midrash) suggests David spoke about Abraham—"The LORD said to my lord [Abraham]"—referring to Genesis 14 where Melchizedek blessed Abraham.

3. **Military/Political Context Unfulfilled:** The psalm emphasizes military conquest ("make your enemies your footstool," "shatter kings"), which Jesus never accomplished. The Messiah should achieve visible political victory over Israel's enemies, not merely spiritual victory.

4. **Melchizedek Priesthood Problematic:** Jewish tradition rejects a non-Levitical priesthood for the Messiah. The Torah establishes the Aaronic/Levitical priesthood as eternal (Exodus 40:15; Numbers 25:13). Introducing a different priestly order contradicts the irrevocability of God's covenant with Aaron.

5. **"My Lord" Explained Differently:** The Hebrew *adoni* means "my master," a term of respect that can apply to humans, not necessarily implying divinity (unlike *Adonai*, the divine name). David could be addressing his descendants or speaking prophetically about the Messiah without implying deity.

## Conclusion

**Debatable fulfillment.** Psalm 110 presents a striking image of the LORD inviting David's "Lord" to sit at His right hand until enemies are subdued, combining royal authority with eternal priesthood after Melchizedek's order. Christians cite substantial evidence for Jesus' fulfillment: His own use of the psalm to teach about the Messiah's divine nature, multiple apostolic testimonies of His ascension and session at God's right hand, Peter's public proclamation before thousands in Jerusalem, and the unique priest-king combination. The psalm addresses a fundamental question—why would David call his descendant "Lord"?—suggesting the Messiah transcends mere human descent. However, the visible subjugation of enemies remains incomplete, requiring belief in progressive fulfillment (spiritual victory accomplished, physical victory awaiting the Second Coming). The non-Levitical priesthood contradicts traditional Jewish understanding of the eternal Aaronic covenant. Jewish scholars debate whether the psalm is even messianic, offering alternative interpretations about David or Abraham. The interpretation ultimately hinges on accepting the Messiah as divine (David's Lord, not merely his descendant), progressive enemy subjugation, the superiority of Melchizedek's priesthood over the Levitical system, and Jesus' resurrection establishing eternal priesthood. Strong theological arguments exist on both sides.
