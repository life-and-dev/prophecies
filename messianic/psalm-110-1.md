# Psalm 110:1 (Sit at My Right Hand)

Who is the mysterious figure that David refers to as his "Lord" in Psalm 110? This short but profound psalm has sparked centuries of debate among scholars and theologians. It presents a unique vision of a figure who is both a victorious king and an eternal priest, invited by the LORD Himself to a position of ultimate authority. We will explore the different interpretations of this prophecy and how it shapes our understanding of the Messiah's nature and mission.

## The Prophecy

> The LORD says to my Lord: **"Sit at My right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool."** — Psalm 110:1 (ESV)

## Apostolic Application

Jesus and his apostles applied Psalm 110 to the Messiah, focusing on his exaltation and eternal priesthood.

### Challenging the Pharisees

Jesus used this psalm to challenge the Pharisees' understanding of the Messiah's identity:

> Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, saying, "What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he?"  
> They said to him, "The son of David." 
> He said to them, "How is it then that David, in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying, ***'The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet"'?*** If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son?"  
> And no one was able to answer him a word. 
> 
> — Matthew 22:41-46 (ESV)

### Ascension to the Right Hand

After His resurrection, Jesus ascended to this position of authority:

> So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, **was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God**. — Mark 16:19 (ESV)

### Pentecost Fulfilled Prophecy

After the many have received from God the Holy Spirit, Peter testified to the fulfillment of this prophecy:

> “Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, [a man](https://son.ofgod.info/nature) attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know — this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God: you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. 
> 
> For David says concerning him, ‘I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken; therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; my flesh also will dwell in hope. For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One see corruption. You have made known to me the paths of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence.’
>
> Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. 
> 
> Being **therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit**, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says,  
>> ‘The LORD said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.” — Psalm 110:1
>
> Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”
>
> — Acts 2:22-36 (ESV)

## Christian Interpretation

Christians believe Jesus fulfilled this prophecy through His ascension and current session at God's right hand. The "session" of Christ is a theological term referring to the period during which Jesus is seated at the right hand of God the Father in heaven.

### Multiple Apostolic Witnesses

Christians point to the numerous times this psalm is quoted in the New Testament to support Jesus' messianic role:
- **Ascension witnessed** (Mark 16:19; Acts 1:9-11): Many disciples witnessed Jesus ascend to heaven.
- **Peter's public testimony** (Acts 2:33-35): Applied the psalm to Jesus' exaltation in front of thousands, including hostile religious leaders.
- **Current position affirmed** (Ephesians 1:20-22; Colossians 3:1): Jesus currently seated at God's right hand.
- **Intercession role** (Romans 8:34): Christ intercedes for believers at God's right hand.

## Jewish Interpretation

Jewish scholars are [divided](https://www.sefaria.org/Psalms.110.1?with=Rashi&lang=bi) on whether Psalm 110 is messianic, presenting several interpretative challenges. Historically, the psalm was recognized as significant within the [Davidic royal tradition](2-samuel-7-12.md).

### Interpretative Challenges

1. **David Speaking About Himself:** Some argue David wrote this as a prophetic psalm about his own kingship, using third-person language poetically.
2. **David About Abraham:** A rabbinic interpretation (Midrash) suggests David spoke about Abraham. In this view, "The LORD said to my lord" refers to Abraham, specifically in the context of Genesis 14 where Melchizedek blessed him.
3. **Military/Political Context Unfulfilled:** The psalm emphasizes military conquest ("make your enemies your footstool," "shatter kings"), which Jesus never accomplished. The Messiah should achieve visible political victory over Israel's enemies, not merely spiritual victory.
4. **Melchizedek Priesthood Problematic:** Jewish tradition rejects a non-Levitical priesthood for the Messiah. The Torah establishes the Aaronic/Levitical priesthood as eternal (Exodus 40:15; Numbers 25:13 (ESV)). Introducing a different priestly order contradicts the irrevocability of God's covenant with Aaron.

#### Responses to Objections

1. **Cannot Be David:** Peter explicitly argues, "David did not ascend into the heavens" (Acts 2:34 (ESV)), therefore David could not be speaking about himself sitting at God's right hand. Additionally, Jesus' question to the Pharisees is compelling: if the Messiah is merely David's descendant, why would David call him "Lord"? (Matthew 22:43-45 (ESV)). In Jewish culture, inferiors address superiors this way, not fathers addressing descendants. This implies the Messiah is David's superior.
2. **Not Abraham:** Some rabbinic interpretations suggest David spoke about Abraham, but this fails because:
   - Melchizedek blessed Abraham (Genesis 14:18-20 (ESV)), not vice versa. The greater blesses the lesser (Hebrews 7:7 (ESV)), so Melchizedek was superior to Abraham. The psalm cannot refer to Abraham receiving Melchizedek's priesthood. 
   - David lived centuries after Abraham. The psalm clearly looks forward, not backward.
3. **Two-Stage Military Victory:** Christians argue for progressive fulfillment. Spiritual victory was accomplished through Jesus' death and resurrection, triumphing over sin, death, and Satan (Colossians 2:15; Hebrews 2:14-15 (ESV)). The word "until" indicates a waiting period. Jesus currently sits at God's right hand while enemies are progressively subdued (1 Corinthians 15:25 (ESV)). Complete physical victory will occur at the Second Coming (Revelation 19:11-21 (ESV)).
4. **Melchizedek Priesthood Superior to Levitical:** Melchizedek's priesthood predates the Levitical system, making it more ancient and foundational (Hebrews 7:1-10 (ESV)). Genesis 14 (ESV) shows Melchizedek as priest-king blessed by God Most High. The Levitical system was "made according to a legal requirement concerning bodily descent," but Christ's priesthood operates "by the power of an indestructible life" (Hebrews 7:16 (ESV)). The very existence of Psalm 110:4 within Scripture proves God intended a priestly order beyond Aaron's line. Hebrews 7:11-19 (ESV) argues that if perfection could come through the Levitical priesthood, God would not prophesy another priest "after the order of Melchizedek."

## Conclusion

According to Jesus, his apostles, and the eyewitnesses during their lifetime, this prophecy had been fulfilled.
