# Psalm 16:10 (Resurrection)

## The Prophecy

> For You will not leave my soul in *Sheol*, **nor will You allow Your Holy One to see corruption**. — Psalm 16:10 (NKJV)

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

The apostle Peter preached at Pentecost, explicitly applying this psalm to Jesus' resurrection:

> “Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, [a man](https://son.ofgod.info/nature) attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know — this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. For David says concerning him,
>
>> ‘I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken; therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; my flesh also will dwell in hope. For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or **let your Holy One see corruption**. You have made known to me the paths of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence.’ — Psalm 16:8-11
>
> Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. 
> 
> Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says,  
>> ‘[The LORD said to my Lord, “Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies your footstool.](psalm-110-1.md)” — Psalm 110:1
>
> Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified.”
>
> — Acts 2:22-36 (ESV)

Peter argues that:
- David died and his tomb remained (therefore couldn't be speaking of himself)
- David spoke prophetically of the "Holy One's" resurrection
- Jesus' body did not "see corruption" (decay)
- Jesus was raised from the dead
- The apostles all witnessed the resurrection

Paul also cited this psalm:

> Therefore he says also in another psalm, **"You will not let your Holy One see corruption."** For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and **saw corruption**, but **he whom God raised up did not see corruption**. — Acts 13:35-37 (ESV)

### Jews

Traditional rabbinic sources consistently interpret Psalm 16 as David speaking about himself rather than the Messiah. Jewish scholars object based on contextual and theological grounds:

- **David Speaking About Himself**: The entire psalm is first-person ("my soul," "your holy one" referring to David himself). David expresses confidence that God will protect him from death during his lifetime. The psalm functions as a prayer for God's protection, not messianic prophecy.
- **Sheol Means the Grave**: In Hebrew thought, Sheol is the grave or realm of the dead—everyone goes there. "Not abandon to Sheol" means "preserve from death" or "rescue from dying," not "resurrect after death." This is standard biblical language for divine protection from premature death. David prays that God will not let him die.
- **"See Corruption" Means "Experience Death"**: The phrase means "don't let me die" or "protect me from decay while alive." This is a prayer for protection from premature death and bodily decay, not prediction of resurrection. The Hebrew word "shachath" (corruption/pit) refers to the grave or destruction that comes with death. David asks God to preserve his life so his body won't decay in a grave.
- **David's Confidence Fulfilled**: God did protect David from many dangers throughout his life. The psalm was fulfilled in David's own experience when God repeatedly delivered him from enemies (Saul, Absalom, etc.). No resurrection is required—God simply preserved David's life.

### Christian

Christians believe Jesus fulfilled this prophecy, arguing that:

- **Peter's Explicit Argument**: Peter directly addresses the Jewish interpretation. He acknowledges David died and his tomb remained with them "to this day" (Acts 2:29). Therefore, David could not have been speaking about himself. Peter argues David spoke prophetically as one who knew God promised to raise up the Messiah from his descendants (Acts 2:30-31). This represents authoritative apostolic interpretation.
- **"See Corruption" Requires Resurrection**: The phrase "not let your holy one see corruption" implies the person dies (enters the grave) but doesn't remain long enough for bodily decay. If this merely meant "preserve from death," the phrase would be "not die" rather than "not see corruption." The mention of corruption/decay implies death occurs but resurrection happens before decomposition. Jesus was buried but rose on the third day before His body decayed.
- **Paul's Contrast**: Paul explicitly contrasts David (who "saw corruption" after death) with Jesus (whom "God raised up" and "did not see corruption") in Acts 13:36-37. This apostolic interpretation clarifies that David experienced death and decay, while Jesus experienced resurrection before corruption.
- **"Your Holy One" Distinguished**: While David calls himself a "holy one" (Hebrew: hasid, meaning faithful/godly one), Peter's application to Jesus as "the Holy One" takes on greater significance. Jesus is the uniquely Holy One of God (Mark 1:24; Luke 4:34; Acts 3:14), making this title ultimately messianic.
- **Timing Matches**: Jesus rose on the third day (Matthew 28:1-6), before significant bodily decomposition would occur. Ancient understanding recognized that decay began after three days, making resurrection before corruption a specific, measurable claim.
- **Apostolic Witness**: Peter appeals to collective apostolic testimony: "of that we all are witnesses" (Acts 2:32). This represents not individual interpretation but the unified testimony of eyewitnesses to the resurrection.
- **Historical Context**: Evidence suggests that Jews in the apostles' lifetime considered Psalm 16:10 as a prophecy about the Messiah ("Holy One"):
    - **David's Distinction**: The apostles argued that David made a clear distinction between himself and the "Holy One" because David's body saw corruption while the Holy One's would not. 
    - **Original Jewish Acceptance**: The argument, used by Peter (Acts 2:29-31) and Paul (Acts 13:35-37), was effective with Jewish audiences, implying their Jewish audience accepted that the Psalm could refer to the Messiah.
    - **Guarding the Tomb**: The Jewish leaders' request to Pilate to guard Jesus' tomb suggests they were aware of the significance of resurrection claims. They remembered Jesus saying, "After three days I will rise" (Matthew 27:63). It would not have been necessary to guard the tomb if there was no such prophecy or expectation; their actions confirm they took the possibility of a claimed fulfillment seriously (Matthew 27:62-66).

## External Historical Evidence
 
 Non-Christian and secular sources from the 1st and 2nd centuries provide indirect historical corroboration for the events surrounding the resurrection:

- **Flavius Josephus (Jewish Historian, c. 37–100 AD)**: In his *[Antiquities of the Jews](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0146%3Abook%3D18%3Asection%3D63)*, Josephus records Jesus' crucifixion under Pilate. A version of this text (Testimonium Flavianum) notes that his followers "reported that he had appeared to them three days after his crucifixion, and that he was alive," confirming that the resurrection claim was the foundational belief of the early movement.
- **Tacitus (Roman Historian, c. 56–120 AD)**: In his *[Annals](https://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0078%3Abook%3D15%3Achapter%3D44)*, Tacitus confirms Jesus' execution by Pontius Pilate and describes a "mischievous superstition" (the resurrection belief) that broke out in Judea and spread to Rome shortly after. 
- **The Nazareth Inscription**: An [archaeological edict](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nazareth_Inscription) from a Roman Emperor (likely Claudius, c. 41 AD) establishing the death penalty for moving bodies from tombs. Its timing and location (Nazareth) suggest a Roman response to the news of an "empty tomb" and claims of resurrection in the region.
- **Hostile Witness (The "Stolen Body" Theory)**: Early Jewish polemics did not deny the tomb was empty; instead, they argued the [disciples stole the body](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matthew_28:13). Historians note that to argue the body was stolen, one must first admit the tomb was indeed empty, providing independent confirmation of its vacancy in 1st-century Jerusalem.

## Conclusion

Modern Jewish scholars interpret Psalm 16 as David's personal prayer for protection from death during his lifetime, not messianic prophecy. The entire psalm is first-person, expressing confidence that God will preserve David from premature death. "Not abandon to Sheol" means rescue from dying, not resurrect after death. "See corruption" means experience death and decay, which David prays to avoid. God did protect David throughout his life, fulfilling the psalm without requiring resurrection.

Peter at Pentecost (Acts 2:29-32) and Paul in Antioch (Acts 13:35-37) explicitly applied Psalm 16:10 to Jesus' resurrection, providing that the general consensus of the Jews at their lifetimes was to consider this prophecy messianic. Peter argues that David died and his tomb remained, therefore David spoke prophetically about the Messiah, not himself. Jesus was buried but rose on the third day before bodily decomposition, literally fulfilling "not let Your Holy One see corruption." The apostles collectively witnessed this resurrection (Acts 2:32).
