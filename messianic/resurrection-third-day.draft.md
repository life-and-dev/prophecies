# Resurrection on the Third Day

## The Prophecy

While Hosea 6:2 in context refers to Israel ("After two days he will revive us; on the third day he will raise us up"), Jesus applied the "third day" pattern to himself:

> And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and **after three days rise again**. — Mark 8:31 (ESV)

## Fulfillment in Jesus

> Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb... But the angel said to the women, "Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. **He is not here, for he has risen**, as he said." — Matthew 28:1, 5-6 (ESV)

Jesus rose on the third day:
- Crucified: Friday (Day 1)
- In tomb: Saturday (Day 2)
- Risen: Sunday (Day 3)

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Jesus predicted it** (Matthew 16:21; 17:23; 20:19): Foretold third day resurrection
- **Fulfilled** (Matthew 28:1-6): Rose on third day
- **Apostolic teaching** (1 Corinthians 15:4): "He was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures"
- **Pattern in Scripture**: Third day significance (Genesis 22:4; Exodus 19:11, 16)

## Jewish Perspective

### Messianic Status

**Not Considered Messianic.**

### Jewish Objections

1. **Context: Israel's national restoration**: Hosea 6:1-3 is Israel's call to repentance after judgment. "After two days... on the third day" is metaphorical language about Israel's restoration from exile—the nation will be "revived" after brief punishment. Describes national restoration, not individual resurrection.

2. **"Days" are figurative periods**: The "two days" and "third day" represent short, indefinite periods—not literal 24-hour days. "Day" often symbolizes an era in prophetic literature. The point is God's restoration will come quickly.

3. **Already fulfilled**: Fulfilled when Israel returned from Babylonian exile after ~70 years (a "short time" in covenant history). The nation was "revived" when they rebuilt Jerusalem and temple.

4. **No individual in view**: Pronouns are plural—"us," "we"—clearly referring to Israel collectively, not one person. Nothing suggests individual Messiah.

5. **Jesus' application not in text**: While Jesus predicted his resurrection on third day (Mark 8:31), he didn't explicitly cite Hosea 6:2. The "third day" detail became significant to Christians post-resurrection, but this doesn't make Hosea 6:2 a prophecy about it.

6. **Pattern vs. prophecy**: Even if there's a "third day" pattern in Scripture (Genesis 22:4; Exodus 19:11, 16; Hosea 6:2), this doesn't make each instance a prophecy of Jesus' resurrection. It's a common biblical motif for divine action, not specific prediction.

## Christian Perspective

### Response

**Paul's citation**: Paul says Jesus "was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures" (1 Corinthians 15:4), indicating Old Testament basis for third-day resurrection expectation.

**Typological fulfillment**: While Hosea 6:2's immediate context is Israel's restoration, it establishes a pattern—restoration/resurrection on the third day. Jesus' resurrection fulfills this pattern at higher level.

**Third day significance**: The recurring third-day motif in Scripture (Isaac's deliverance on third day, Genesis 22:4; giving of Law on third day, Exodus 19:11, 16) points to divine vindication and new beginning. Jesus' resurrection consummates this pattern.

**Corporate and individual**: Just as Adam represented humanity and Israel represents God's people, Jesus represents and fulfills Israel's calling. What happened to Israel collectively (death in exile, restoration) happens to Jesus individually (death, resurrection), who then applies it to all believers.

## Assessment

**Christian View**: While Hosea 6:2 primarily addresses Israel's restoration, the third-day pattern finds ultimate fulfillment in Jesus' resurrection. Paul affirms this was "in accordance with the Scriptures."

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Debatable. Jesus did rise on the third day, matching the pattern. Paul says it accords with Scripture. However, whether Hosea 6:2 was intended as messianic prophecy or describes Israel's restoration is disputed. The interpretation depends on whether typological/pattern fulfillment constitutes genuine prophecy fulfillment, or whether only direct predictions qualify.
