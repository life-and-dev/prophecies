## The Prophecy

> He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, **yet he opened not his mouth**; **like a lamb that is led to the slaughter**, and like a sheep that before its shearers is silent, so he opened not his mouth. By oppression and judgment he was taken away; and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, **stricken for the transgression of my people**? — Isaiah 53:7-8 (ESV)

Silent before accusers, led to slaughter, executed unjustly.

## Fulfillment in Jesus

> Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, "Are you the King of the Jews?" Jesus said, "You have said so." But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, **he gave no answer**. Then Pilate said to him, "Do you not hear how many things they testify against you?" But **he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge**, so that the governor was greatly amazed. — Matthew 27:11-14 (ESV)

Before Herod:

> So he questioned him at some length, but **he made no answer**. — Luke 23:9 (ESV)
