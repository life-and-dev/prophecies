# Teaching with Authority

> **Fulfillment Category:** Vague or Debatable
>
> This prophecy either lacks specific details or its original context makes messianic interpretation questionable. The passage is not considered messianic by Jewish scholars and could refer to general Torah education rather than a specific messianic figure.

## The Prophecy

Isaiah prophesied:

> All your children shall be **taught by the LORD**, and great shall be the peace of your children. — Isaiah 54:13 (ESV)

God himself would teach His people through the Messiah.

## Fulfillment in Jesus

Jesus applied this prophecy to himself:

> It is written in the Prophets, **"And they will all be taught by God."** Everyone who has heard and learned from the Father comes to me—not that anyone has seen the Father except he who is from God; he has seen the Father. — John 6:45-46 (ESV)

And after hearing Jesus teach, the crowds recognized this authority:

> And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching, for **he was teaching them as one who had authority**, and not as their scribes. — Matthew 7:28-29 (ESV)

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Jesus' self-application** (John 6:45-46): Directly applies "taught by God" to himself
- **Recognized authority** (Matthew 7:28-29): Crowds astonished at his authoritative teaching
- **Divine teacher** (John 3:2): Nicodemus acknowledges "we know that you are a teacher come from God"
- **Words are spirit and life** (John 6:63): Jesus' teaching imparts spiritual life

## Jewish Perspective

### Messianic Status

**Not Considered Messianic.** Isaiah 54:13 is generally not viewed by Jews as a direct messianic prophecy.

### Jewish Objections

1. **Context is national restoration**: Isaiah 54 describes Israel's restoration after exile—"your children" refers to the Jewish people being taught by God through prophets and Torah study, not through one individual Messiah.

2. **Already fulfilled**: Jews see this as fulfilled through the return from Babylonian exile, the rebuilding of Jerusalem, and the establishment of Torah education systems.

3. **Present reality**: Traditional Judaism emphasizes that all Jews are currently taught by God through Torah study, synagogue instruction, and rabbinic teaching—this is an ongoing reality, not awaiting messianic fulfillment.

4. **Misapplication**: Jesus' claim that people must "come to me" to be taught by the Father (John 6:45-46) is seen as adding to Scripture. The original text doesn't mention a mediator—it says people will be "taught by the LORD" directly through His word.

## Christian Perspective

### Responses to Jewish Objections

#### 1. Jesus as Divine Teacher

Christians argue Jesus doesn't replace Torah but fulfills it as the living Word (John 1:1, 14). God teaches through Jesus, who is the perfect revelation of the Father.

**Greater than Moses**: Just as God taught through Moses at Sinai, He teaches through Jesus—but Jesus is greater than Moses (Hebrews 3:3-6). The prophecy finds ultimate fulfillment in the superior mediator.

**Direct divine teaching**: When people hear Jesus, they hear the Father (John 14:9-10: "Whoever has seen me has seen the Father... The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own authority, but the Father who dwells in me does his works").

#### 2. Eschatological Fulfillment

**New covenant prophecy**: Isaiah 54 is closely connected to Isaiah 53 (suffering servant) and points forward to the new covenant era. In the new covenant, God writes His law on hearts (Jeremiah 31:31-34) and teaches internally through His Spirit.

**Already begun**: This teaching has begun through Jesus and the Spirit he sent, but will be fully realized when "all shall know me, from the least of them to the greatest" (Jeremiah 31:34).

#### 3. Messianic Context

**Broader Isaiah context**: While Isaiah 54:13 addresses restoration, the broader context (Isaiah 52:13-53:12) clearly describes the Messiah's suffering and exaltation. Isaiah 54 describes the blessings following Messiah's atoning work—including divine teaching.

**Children of the servant**: The "children" taught by God are the spiritual offspring of the suffering servant (Isaiah 53:10: "he shall see his offspring"). Those who believe in Jesus become God's children and receive divine teaching.

## Assessment

**Christian View**: Jesus fulfills Isaiah 54:13 as the divine teacher through whom God instructs His people. His authoritative teaching, recognized by crowds and disciples, demonstrates fulfillment of God personally teaching His children.

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Debatable. Jesus' authoritative teaching is well-documented, and his self-application of the prophecy is explicit. However, Jews legitimately question whether the prophecy requires a messianic mediator or refers to ongoing Torah education. The interpretation depends on whether Isaiah 54 is read as messianic (following the suffering servant in Isaiah 53) or as general restoration promise, and whether "taught by the LORD" allows for divine teaching through an incarnate mediator or requires direct instruction through written Torah alone.
