# Titles of Divine Authority

> **Fulfillment Category:** Vague or Debatable

> This prophecy either lacks specific details or its original context makes messianic interpretation questionable. The visible endless government and peace are not yet realized, and the immediate contextual shift to judgment on Israel creates legitimate questions about whether the original prophecy was messianic or addressed immediate historical circumstances.

## The Prophecy

Isaiah described the coming child with remarkable titles:

> For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and **the government shall be upon his shoulder**, and his name shall be called **Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace**. Of the increase of his government and of peace **there will be no end**, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and **forevermore**... — Isaiah 9:6-7 (ESV)

A child who would bear *titles of deity* and establish an *eternal* government.

However, the context continues:

> The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this. The Lord has sent a word against Jacob, and it will fall on Israel; — Isaiah 9:7-8 (ESV)

This suggests the prophecy may have been about judgment on Israel in Isaiah's own time, not necessarily a messianic prophecy.

## Fulfillment in Jesus

Traditionally, [Trinitarian](https://son.ofgod.info/trinity) Christians understood this as prophetic word about a child who would bear titles of deity and establish an eternal government.

Jesus did claim to be the King of the eternal Kingdom of God (Matthew 28:18-19), exercising divine authority. However, the immediate context (verse 8) describing judgment on Israel suggests the original audience may have understood this differently.

### Evidence from the New Testament

- **Government/authority** (Matthew 28:18): "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me"
- **Eternal kingdom** (Luke 1:33): "Of his kingdom there will be no end"
- **Wonderful Counselor**: Jesus' wisdom and teaching amazed audiences (Matthew 7:28-29)
- **Prince of Peace**: Jesus brings peace with God (Romans 5:1; John 14:27)

Christians often apply these titles to Jesus, though they recognize the contextual challenges.

## Jewish Perspective

### Messianic Status

**Debated/Accepted as Messianic.** While some Jewish sources recognize messianic elements, most reject the Christian interpretation of divine titles.

### Jewish Objections

1. **Translation issues**: "Mighty God" (El Gibbor) in Hebrew doesn't necessarily mean deity. It can also mean "mighty hero" or "divine warrior"—a human being with God-given strength. The term "Everlasting Father" is interpreted as "father of eternity," meaning a long-lived or enduring ruler, not "God the Father" as Christians claim.

2. **Historical context**: Some argue verses 6-7 originally referred to King Hezekiah as a contemporary fulfillment. The titles describe an exceptional king, not necessarily deity incarnate.

3. **Unfulfilled conditions**: The prophecy promises "of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end," which Jews argue requires visible, earthly peace and ever-expanding territorial rule. Jesus did not establish such a government—no visible peace, no expanding territory, no political reign.

4. **Temporal disconnect**: Since the prophecy speaks of a child "born to us" in past tense and "government on his shoulders" in present/future tense, Jews argue this describes events in Isaiah's own era, possibly Hezekiah's birth and reign (born during Isaiah's ministry, reigned with God's blessing).

5. **Judgment context**: Verse 8 immediately shifts to judgment on Jacob/Israel, suggesting the child's role involves executing judgment in Isaiah's time, not a distant messianic future.

## Christian Perspective

### Responses to Jewish Objections

#### 1. Divine Titles Intentional

**El Gibbor elsewhere means God**: The same title "El Gibbor" (Mighty God) appears in Isaiah 10:21 referring to Yahweh Himself: "A remnant will return, a remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God [El Gibbor]." If Isaiah uses this title for Yahweh elsewhere, its application to the child in 9:6 suggests divine identity.

**Compound titles unique**: The combination of titles—Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace—collectively transcends any human king. No mere human could appropriately bear all four titles simultaneously.

**"Everlasting Father" unprecedented**: While "father of eternity" could describe longevity, the Hebrew "Avi Ad" (Everlasting Father) suggests more than long life—it implies the source and sustainer of eternal existence, a role reserved for deity.

#### 2. Not Hezekiah

**Timing problem**: Isaiah 9 was written before Hezekiah's birth (Isaiah's ministry began ~740 BC; Hezekiah born ~740 BC, became king 715 BC). If referring to Hezekiah, the past tense "a child is born" would be premature.

**Titles never applied**: Scripture never calls Hezekiah "Mighty God" or "Everlasting Father." While Hezekiah was a good king, he doesn't fit the supernatural titles.

**Kingdom not endless**: Hezekiah's reign lasted 29 years (2 Kings 18:2) and his kingdom didn't increase perpetually. The prophecy requires "no end" government.

#### 3. Two-Stage Fulfillment

**Already/not yet framework**: Christians acknowledge the tension—Jesus inaugurated the kingdom spiritually (Mark 1:15) but hasn't yet established visible universal peace. The prophecy has:

- **First coming**: Kingdom established spiritually; Jesus exercises divine authority
- **Second coming**: Visible, endless peace; government increases perpetually as all nations submit

**Peace progressive**: The "Prince of Peace" brings spiritual peace with God now (Romans 5:1) and will establish political peace when he returns (Isaiah 2:4; Revelation 21:4).

#### 4. Judgment Not Contradiction

**Dual purpose**: The Messiah both blesses and judges. Isaiah 9:6-7 describes blessing (child given, peace); 9:8ff describes judgment on rebellious Israel. Both are messianic functions.

**Pattern of judgment**: Jesus will execute judgment at his return (2 Thessalonians 1:7-10). The immediate judgment on Israel in Isaiah's day prefigures ultimate judgment by Messiah.

**Contextual flow**: Ancient Hebrew poetry doesn't always follow chronological sequence. Isaiah 9:6-7 (messianic blessing) can be followed by 9:8ff (contemporary judgment) without contradiction.

## Assessment

**Christian View**: Jesus fulfills Isaiah 9:6-7 as the divine Son given to humanity, bearing titles of deity, establishing an eternal spiritual kingdom that will be consummated at his second coming. The context in verse 8 doesn't negate the messianic nature but shows the dual themes of blessing (Messiah) and judgment (Israel's rebellion).

**Strength of Fulfillment**: Debatable. The titles are unprecedented and suggest deity, which aligns with Trinitarian Christology. However, the visible, endless government and peace are not yet realized, requiring a two-stage fulfillment framework. Additionally, the immediate contextual shift to judgment on Israel creates legitimate questions about whether the original prophecy was messianic or addressed immediate historical circumstances. The interpretation depends heavily on whether one accepts dual fulfillment, divine titles for the child, and progressive kingdom establishment.
