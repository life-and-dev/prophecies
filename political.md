# Political Prophecies

These prophecies originally warned the original audience against the destruction of a kingdom or provided hope in troubling times. They are mainly concerned about the rise or fall of a king, kingdom or some other world events that effects the political powers.

However, for us they contain scientific measures to prove the credibility of [the inspired scriptures](https://word.ofgod.info/inspired).
