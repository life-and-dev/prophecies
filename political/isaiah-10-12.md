# Isaiah 10:12 (Assyria)

## Prophecy

While God used Assyria as a "rod" to punish Israel, Isaiah predicted that God would subsequently punish the king of Assyria for his arrogant pride.

> "When the Lord has finished all his work on Mount Zion and on Jerusalem, he will punish the speech of the arrogant heart of the king of Assyria and the boastful look in his eyes." — Isaiah 10:12 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic View

Isaiah delivered this prophecy [during the 740s BCE](https://www.britannica.com/biography/Isaiah), at the height of [Assyrian power under Tiglath-pileser III](https://cojs.org/isaiah_the_prophet-_8th_century_bce/), when the empire appeared invincible. The Neo-Assyrian Empire collapsed swiftly and completely. Its capital, **Nineveh**, was [destroyed in 612 BCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Nineveh_(612_BC)) by the [Babylonians and Medes](https://www.worldhistory.org/nineveh/), and the empire vanished from history, fulfilling the judgment against its arrogance. Unlike other ancient powers such as Egypt and Babylon which survived in various forms, [Assyria disappeared completely as a political entity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medo-Babylonian_conquest_of_the_Assyrian_Empire), never to be restored.

## Conclusion

The total collapse of the seemingly invincible Assyrian Empire demonstrates the prophetic judgment pronounced against it.
