# Isaiah 10:21-22 (Remnant Returning)

## Prophecy

Isaiah predicted that despite national judgment, a faithful remnant would survive and return to God.

> "A remnant will return, the remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God. For though your people Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will return." — Isaiah 10:21-22 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic Confirmation

Archaeology and secular history confirm the key events predicted by Isaiah, specifically the preservation of Jerusalem (the immediate remnant) and the policy of return from exile (the future remnant).

#### The Taylor Prism (Sennacherib's Annals)

Isaiah prophesied that while Assyria would sweep through the land, Jerusalem would not fall. The **[Taylor Prism](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W_1855-1229-1)** (housed in the British Museum) contains Sennacherib's own account of the 701 BCE campaign. In it, the Assyrian king boasts of conquering 46 Judean cities and trapping King Hezekiah "like a bird in a cage" in Jerusalem, yet significantly—and in contrast to his other conquests—he **never claims to have captured the city** or harmed the king. This silence corroborates the biblical account that the capital and its remnant survived.

#### The Cyrus Cylinder

Isaiah prophesied that a remnant would return from Babylon, a prediction made nearly two centuries before the event. The **[Cyrus Cylinder](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W_1880-0617-1941)** (also in the British Museum) is a clay artifact from the 6th century BCE that confirms the policy of Cyrus the Great. The text describes Cyrus's conquest of Babylon and his decree allowing displaced peoples to return to their homelands and rebuild their sanctuaries. This historical policy provided the legal framework for the Jewish return recorded in Ezra and Nehemiah, fulfilling the prophecy that the exiles would return.

### Biblical Confirmation

Both Jewish and Christian scholars agree that Isaiah’s prophecy was historically fulfilled in two stages. Isaiah famously embodied this prophecy by naming his son **Shear-Jashub**, which means "a remnant shall return" (Isaiah 7:3), using his own child as a living sign of this promise.

The first fulfillment occurred in 701 BCE during the Assyrian crisis. A remnant of Judah was saved when the angel of the LORD destroyed the Assyrian army besieging Jerusalem. This event is recorded in 2 Kings:

> "And that night the angel of the Lord went out and struck down 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians. And when people arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies." — 2 Kings 19:35 (ESV)

The second fulfillment occurred in the 6th century BCE when the exiles returned from Babylonian captivity. Approximately 42,360 Jews returned to Jerusalem under Ezra and Nehemiah, fulfilling the promise that a remnant would return. The remnant theme emphasizes both judgment (only a small number survived/returned) and hope (God preserved a faithful core).

### Christian Confirmation

The Apostle Paul recognized this historical pattern and applied it spiritually to his own time in Romans 9:27. He explained that just as a faithful remnant was preserved through the exile, a remnant of Israel had accepted the Gospel by faith. This application confirms the principle that God always preserves a faithful remnant.

## Conclusion

Historians and archaeologists have confirmed that this prophecy was fulfilled exactly as Isaiah predicted. The preservation of Jerusalem from Sennacherib's army and the later return of Jewish exiles under Cyrus the Great—verified by artifacts like the Taylor Prism and the Cyrus Cylinder—demonstrate the historical accuracy of Isaiah's words.
