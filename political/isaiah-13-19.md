# Isaiah 13:17,19-20 (Babylon)

## Prophecy

Isaiah predicted the permanent desolation of Babylon, identifying the **Medes** as the instrument of judgment.

> Behold, I am stirring up the **Medes** against them... — Isaiah 13:17 (ESV)

> And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the splendor and pomp of the Chaldeans, will be like Sodom and Gomorrah when God overthrew them. It will **never be inhabited** or lived in for all generations... — Isaiah 13:19-20 (ESV)

## Textual & Historical Nuance

Critics often point out that it was **Cyrus the Persian** (not the Medes alone) who conquered Babylon in 539 BCE. However, historical context clarifies this:
*   **Medo-Persian Empire:** Cyrus ruled a combined empire of Medes and Persians. The two groups were closely allied and ethnically related.
*   **Cyrus's Heritage:** Cyrus's mother was Mandane of Media, making him half-Mede.
*   **Contemporary Usage:** Greek historians like Herodotus and Thucydides often referred to the Persian wars as "Median" affairs, showing the terms were often used interchangeably or inclusively in the ancient world.

## Fulfillment

### Biblical View

The prophet **Jeremiah** also delivered an extensive prophecy against Babylon, dedicating two full chapters to its downfall (Jeremiah 50-51). He predicted that Babylon would become "a heap of ruins, a haunt of jackals, a horror and a hissing, without an inhabitant" (Jeremiah 51:37). His detailed account reinforces Isaiah's prophecy, describing the sudden nature of the attack and the terror that would seize the city. The combined testimony of Isaiah and Jeremiah provides a powerful, dual witness to Babylon's prophesied end.

### Historians

While Cyrus conquered Babylon in 539 BCE without immediately destroying it, the city began a long decline. It was eventually abandoned and fell into ruin. By the time of the New Testament, it was largely deserted. Today, the site of ancient Babylon (in modern-day Iraq) is a ruin, uninhabited as a living city, fulfilling the prophecy of permanent desolation.

## Conclusion

Every measurable aspect of the prophecy was fulfilled according to historians. The city of Babylon, once the greatest in the world, is now an uninhabited archaeological site, confirming the prediction that it would "never be inhabited" again.
