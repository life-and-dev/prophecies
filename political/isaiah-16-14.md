# The Doom of Moab

## Prophecy

Isaiah gave a very specific, time-bound prophecy regarding the nation of Moab, stating its glory would fade within a precise timeframe.

> "But now the LORD has spoken, saying, 'In three years, like the years of a hired worker, the glory of Moab will be brought into contempt...'" — Isaiah 16:14 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic View

Historical records from the Assyrian empire, specifically during the reigns of [**Tiglath-Pileser III**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiglath-Pileser_III) and [**Sargon II**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sargon_II), confirm military campaigns into the Transjordan region that subjugated Moab. Moab was reduced from an independent kingdom to a vassal state, stripping away its former glory and independence. The specificity of "three years" (like a contract worker's fixed term) indicates a precise near-term fulfillment.

- The Annals of Tiglath-Pileser III document campaigns in the Transjordan region and tribute from surrounding nations

## Conclusion

**Historic fulfillment**

The subjugation of Moab by Assyrian forces in the late 8th century BCE fulfills the prophetic warning.
