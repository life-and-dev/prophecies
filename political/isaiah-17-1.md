# Isaiah 17:1 (Damascus)

## Prophecy

Isaiah prophesied the destruction of Damascus, the capital of Syria (Aram), which was threatening Judah at the time.

> "Behold, Damascus will cease to be a city and will become a heap of ruins." — Isaiah 17:1 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic View

This prophecy was fulfilled in **732 BCE**, shortly after Isaiah spoke it. The Assyrian king [**Tiglath-Pileser III**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiglath-Pileser_III) conquered Damascus, killed its king Rezin, and deported its population (recorded in 2 Kings 16:9 and Assyrian annals).

While Damascus is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, the prophecy referred to the destruction of the **independent Aramean kingdom** of Damascus. The city as a political power was destroyed ("ceased to be a city" in the political sense) and became a vassal ruin.

## Conclusion

**Historic fulfillment**

The prediction of Damascus's fall to Assyria was historically verified in the 8th century BCE.
