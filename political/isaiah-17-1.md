# Isaiah 17:1 (Damascus)

## Prophecy

Isaiah prophesied the destruction of Damascus, the capital of Syria (Aram), which was threatening Judah at the time.

> "Behold, Damascus will cease to be a city and will become a heap of ruins." — Isaiah 17:1 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Biblical View

The historical fulfillment of these prophecies is recorded in **2 Kings 16:9**, which states that the king of Assyria went up against Damascus, captured it, killed its king Rezin, and carried its people away into exile.

### Historic View

This prophecy was fulfilled in **732 BCE**, shortly after Isaiah spoke it. The Assyrian king [**Tiglath-Pileser III**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiglath-Pileser_III) conquered Damascus, killed its king Rezin, and deported its population, as confirmed by Assyrian annals.

While Damascus is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world, the prophecy referred to the destruction of the **independent Aramean kingdom** of Damascus. The city as a political power was destroyed ("ceased to be a city" in the political sense) and became a vassal ruin.

## Conclusion

The prediction of Damascus's fall to Assyria was historically verified in the 8th century BCE.
