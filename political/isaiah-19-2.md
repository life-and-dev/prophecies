# Isaiah 19:2 (Egypt's Civil War)

## Prophecy

Isaiah prophesied a period of internal strife and civil war within Egypt.

> "And I will stir up Egyptians against Egyptians, and they will fight, each against another and each against his neighbor, city against city, kingdom against kingdom." — Isaiah 19:2 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic View

This prophecy accurately describes the period of chaos in Egyptian history known as the **Dodecarchy** (rule of twelve kings) following the decline of the 25th Dynasty. Egypt fractured into competing city-states and rival kingdoms, leading to civil war before **Psammetichus I** (Psamtik I) eventually unified the country around 664 BCE.

## Conclusion

The description of "city against city, kingdom against kingdom" matches the fragmented political state of Egypt during the Assyrian period.
