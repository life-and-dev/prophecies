# Isaiah 19:4 (Egypt's Defeat)

## Prophecy

Isaiah predicted that Egypt would be delivered into the hand of a "hard master" and a "fierce king."

> "And I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a hard master, and a fierce king will rule over them, declares the Lord GOD of hosts." — Isaiah 19:4 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Biblical View

Later prophets reaffirmed that a foreign king would execute God's judgment on Egypt. **Ezekiel** prophesied that God would give the land of Egypt to **Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon** as payment for his army, who would carry off its wealth and plunder it (Ezekiel 29:18-20).

Similarly, **Jeremiah** predicted that Nebuchadnezzar would come and strike the land of Egypt, setting up his throne in the land and shattering the sacred pillars of their temples (Jeremiah 43:10-13). While Isaiah's prophecy was fulfilled by the Assyrians, these later prophecies point to a subsequent judgment by the Babylonians.

### Historic View

Isaiah's prophecy was fulfilled by the conquest of Egypt by the Assyrian king **Esarhaddon** in 671 BCE, and later confirmed by his son **Ashurbanipal**. The Assyrian rule over Egypt was notoriously harsh and humiliating, matching the prophecy's description. The subsequent invasion by Nebuchadnezzar, prophesied by Jeremiah and Ezekiel, also came to pass, further devastating the nation.

## Conclusion

The historical record of the brutal Assyrian conquest of Egypt, followed by the Babylonian invasion, validates the prophecies of Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel.
