# Isaiah 19:4 (Egypt's Defeat)

## Prophecy

Isaiah predicted that Egypt would be delivered into the hand of a "hard master" and a "fierce king."

> "And I will give over the Egyptians into the hand of a hard master, and a fierce king will rule over them, declares the Lord GOD of hosts." — Isaiah 19:4 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic View

This was fulfilled by the conquest of Egypt by the Assyrian king **Esarhaddon** in 671 BCE, and later confirmed by his son **Ashurbanipal**. The Assyrian rule over Egypt was notoriously harsh and humiliating, matching the prophecy's description.

## Conclusion

The historical record of the brutal Assyrian conquest of Egypt validates this prophecy.
