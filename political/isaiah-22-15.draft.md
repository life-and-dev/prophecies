# The Demotion of Shebna

## Prophecy

Isaiah delivered a specific personal prophecy against Shebna, the royal steward, predicting he would be deposed from his high office.

> "Behold, the LORD will hurl you away violently... I will thrust you from your office, and you will be pulled down from your station." — Isaiah 22:17-19 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic View

By the time of the Assyrian siege recorded in Isaiah 36:3 (and 2 Kings 18:18), the prophecy had been fulfilled.
*   **Eliakim** is listed as the one "over the household" (the steward).
*   **Shebna** is listed as "the secretary" (a lower rank).

This incidental detail in the historical narrative confirms that the changing of the guard predicted by Isaiah actually took place. While direct extrabiblical mentions of Shebna are scarce, the historical context of his office and a [possible tomb inscription provide corroborating evidence](https://biblehub.com/q/evidence_for_shebna's_downfall.htm) for the biblical account.

## Conclusion

**Historic fulfillment**

The biblical record confirms the specific administrative change predicted by Isaiah occurred within the lifetime of the individuals named.
