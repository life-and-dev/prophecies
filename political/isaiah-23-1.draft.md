# Judgment and Restoration of Tyre

## Prophecy

Isaiah predicted the destruction of the wealthy Phoenician port city of Tyre.

> Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for **Tyre is laid waste**, without house or harbor! — Isaiah 23:1 (ESV)

A later section specifies a 70-year period of being forgotten, followed by a return to commerce.

> **Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years**... At the end of seventy years, the LORD will visit Tyre, and **she will return to her wages** and will prostitute herself with all the kingdoms of the world. — Isaiah 23:15-17 (ESV)

## Evidence the "70 Years" Was Added Later

Scholars have discovered evidence that verses 15-18 (the part about "70 years forgotten" and restoration) were **written by different authors at a later time**, possibly to explain why the original prophecy didn't come true as expected.

The Evidence:

1. **Different Historical Periods**: [Mark Leuchter's scholarly study](https://www.bsw.org/biblica/vol-87-2006/tyre-s-70-years-in-isaiah-23-15-18/115/) (published in the academic journal *Biblica*, 2006) demonstrates that verses 15-18 were written during King Josiah's reign (late 7th century BCE), **over 100 years after Isaiah lived**

2. **Different Theological Language**: The "70 years" section uses [Mesopotamian theological concepts](https://readingreligion.org/9780198816768/a-redactional-study-of-the-book-of-isaiah-13-23/) from Esarhaddon's era that weren't part of Isaiah's 8th-century vocabulary

3. **Literary Layers**: [Jongkyung Lee's redaction study](https://academic.oup.com/book/6793) (*A Redactional Study of the Book of Isaiah 13-23*, Oxford University Press, 2018) identifies multiple editorial additions throughout Isaiah 13-23, including verses 15-18 in chapter 23

4. **The "70 Years" Formula**: This specific time period appears in other biblical texts (Jeremiah) as a [symbolic number for a complete period of judgment](https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/47781/isaiahs-prophecy-of-70-years-of-tyre), not a literal timeline

5. **Dead Sea Scrolls Confirmation**: The [Great Isaiah Scroll](https://journal.interpreterfoundation.org/the-great-isaiah-scroll-1qisaa-catalogue-of-textual-variants/) (~125 BCE) contains these verses, confirming they were added by 125 BCE but not proving they were original to Isaiah's 8th-century ministry

What This Means:

Later editors—likely prophetic scribes during the 7th or 6th century BCE—saw that Tyre wasn't permanently destroyed as verse 1 seemed to predict. They probably added verses 15-18 to reinterpret the prophecy: "Yes, Tyre will experience judgment, but it's temporary (70 years), then restoration." This was a **normal practice in ancient times**—not fraud or deceive, but how prophetic communities updated and reapplied earlier oracles to new situations.

## Fulfillment

### Debatable View

The literal fulfillment of this prophecy is highly debated.

**The Problem:**
*   **Nebuchadnezzar's Failure:** Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon besieged Tyre (586-573 BCE) but [failed to capture the island city](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tyre_(586–573_BC)). The Bible itself acknowledges this in Ezekiel 29:18 ("he and his army got no reward from Tyre").
*   **No 70-Year Abandonment:** Tyre experienced only about 36-40 years of diminished status under Babylonian control (573-539 BCE). The city was **never abandoned**—it remained continuously inhabited and commercially active.
*   **Alexander's Conquest:** [Alexander the Great conquered Tyre](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/107/alexanders-siege-of-tyre-332-bce/) in 332 BCE, but the city was rebuilt and thrived for centuries. [Tyre still exists today](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyre,_Lebanon) as Sur, Lebanon.

#### Critical Academic View

[Mainstream biblical scholarship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaticinium_ex_eventu) views this as an example of how ancient communities handled [failed prophecies](https://www.pthu.nl/en/bibleblog/2024/10/when-prophecy-doesnt-come-true/):

*   The original oracle (verses 1-14) predicted Tyre's destruction during the Assyrian period (8th century BCE)
*   When this didn't happen as expected, later editors added verses 15-18 to reinterpret it
*   This is called ["prophecy after the event"](https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/53962/were-the-prophesies-in-isaiah-and-ezekiel-about-tyre-actually-fulfilled)—writing as if predicting, but actually reflecting known history
*   Scholar [Robert P. Carroll documented](https://www.amazon.com/When-prophecy-failed-reactions-traditions/dp/0334017890) how biblical communities rationalized unfulfilled prophecies through creative reinterpretation

**Conservative Explanation:**
Conservatives (e.g., John N. Oswalt, Gleason Archer) argue for a symbolic or "in principle" fulfillment:
*   **Symbolic Time:** "70 years" represents the duration of the Babylonian Empire (606-539 BCE), during which Tyre's independence was suppressed.
*   **"Forgotten":** Refers to a loss of commercial dominance rather than total physical destruction.
*   **Conditional:** Prophecies of judgment can be averted or modified by human response (Jeremiah 18:7-10).

## Conclusion

**Debatable fulfillment**

While Tyre eventually fell to Alexander the Great, the specific details of the "70 years" and the immediate destruction by Babylon were not literally fulfilled as described. The evidence of later editorial addition suggests the text was updated by the community to address this discrepancy, making it a complex case of "debatable" fulfillment.
