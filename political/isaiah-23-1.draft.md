# The Prophecies Against Tyre

The biblical prophecies concerning the Phoenician city-state of Tyre, found in Isaiah 23 and Ezekiel 26-28, are among the most detailed and debated in the Old Testament. They predict a total and permanent destruction, but the historical outcome has led to multiple, conflicting interpretations.

## The Prophecies

Two prophets, Isaiah and Ezekiel, delivered major oracles against Tyre.

**Isaiah's Prophecy (Isaiah 23):**
Isaiah foretold the destruction of Tyre, describing it as "laid waste, without house or harbor" (Isaiah 23:1). A later passage specifies a period of decline and subsequent return to commerce:
> "Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years... At the end of seventy years, the LORD will visit Tyre, and she will return to her wages." — Isaiah 23:15-17 (ESV)

**Ezekiel's Prophecy (Ezekiel 26):**
Writing just before the Babylonian siege, Ezekiel gave a more detailed, multi-stage prophecy:
*   **Many Nations:** God would "bring many nations against you, as the sea brings up its waves" (Ezekiel 26:3).
*   **Nebuchadnezzar's Siege:** The first wave would be led by "Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon," who would attack the mainland settlements, build siege works, and break down the walls and towers (Ezekiel 26:7-9).
*   **Total Destruction:** The city's stones, timber, and soil would be laid "in the midst of the water" (Ezekiel 26:12).
*   **Permanent Desolation:** The site would become a "bare rock... a place for the spreading of nets," and the city would "never be rebuilt" (Ezekiel 26:4, 14).

## The Historical Record

Tyre consisted of two main parts: a heavily fortified city on an island and an older settlement on the mainland known as Ushu or Palaetyrus ("Old Tyre"). The city faced two major sieges by conquerors who are central to the prophetic debate.

1.  **Siege by Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon (586–573 BCE):** Nebuchadnezzar besieged Tyre for 13 years. While he likely captured and destroyed the mainland settlement, he was unable to conquer the island fortress. The siege ended in a negotiated settlement where Tyre accepted Babylonian authority but was not destroyed or plundered. The Bible itself notes this outcome in a later chapter: "[Nebuchadnezzar] and his army had no wages from Tyre for the labor that he had performed against it" ([Ezekiel 29:18](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tyre_(586%E2%80%93573_BC)#Biblical_connections)).

2.  **Siege by Alexander the Great (332 BCE):** Centuries later, Alexander the Great conquered the island city. To do so, his army constructed a massive causeway from the mainland to the island. According to historical accounts, he used the rubble and debris from the ruins of Old Tyre to build this mole, effectively scraping the mainland site clean and casting its remains into the sea. After a brutal seven-month siege, the city fell, 8,000 Tyrians were killed, and [30,000 were sold into slavery](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/107/alexanders-siege-of-tyre-332-bce/).

## Interpretive View 1: Prophecy Fulfilled

This view argues that the prophecies were fulfilled literally and precisely through the combined actions of Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander the Great.

*   **"Many Nations":** The prophecy was not limited to Nebuchadnezzar. The reference to "many nations" (Ezekiel 26:3) indicated a multi-stage destruction. Nebuchadnezzar was the first wave, and Alexander the Great was a subsequent, decisive wave.
*   **Scraped Bare:** Alexander's construction of the causeway using the rubble of the mainland city is seen as a literal fulfillment of the prediction that Tyre's "stones, timber, and soil" would be laid "in the midst of the water" and the site made a "bare rock" ([Ezekiel 26:12, 4](https://biblearchaeology.org/research/divided-kingdom/3304-ezekiel-26114-a-proof-text-for-inerrancy-or-fallibility-of-the-old-testament)).
*   **"Never be Rebuilt":** Proponents argue this does not mean no city could ever exist on the spot, but that the great Phoenician city-state—the ancient "queen of the seas"—would never be restored to its former glory, power, and independence. The original mainland city [was never rebuilt and its location may now be under water](https://apologeticspress.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/0610.pdf), and while a city exists on the former island, the ancient political and commercial entity is gone forever.

## Interpretive View 2: Prophecy Unfulfilled or Partially Fulfilled

This view argues that the specifics of the prophecies did not occur as predicted, constituting a failed or only partially fulfilled prophecy.

*   **Nebuchadnezzar's Role:** The prophecy in Ezekiel 26 explicitly names Nebuchadnezzar as the one who would carry out the full destruction, including plundering the city and throwing its rubble into the sea. [History shows he failed to do this](https://www.pthu.nl/en/bibleblog/2024/10/when-prophecy-doesnt-come-true/). Invoking Alexander, who was not named in the text, is seen as an anachronistic attempt to "rescue" the prophecy.
*   **Internal Correction:** Ezekiel 29:18 is interpreted as an admission within the Bible itself that the prophecy of Ezekiel 26 failed. God compensates Nebuchadnezzar with the plunder of Egypt because he received no "wages" from Tyre.
*   **"Never be Rebuilt":** The most direct challenge to the prophecy is the continued existence of the city of Tyre in modern Lebanon. It remains one of the [oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyre,_Lebanon), which directly contradicts a literal reading of the statement that it would "never be rebuilt."

## Scholarly and Textual Analysis

Textual criticism adds further layers to the debate.

*   **Later Additions in Isaiah:** Many scholars argue that Isaiah 23:15-18, the section mentioning the "70 years," was not part of the original 8th-century BCE oracle. Based on linguistic and theological evidence, they propose it was a [later redaction (edit) during the 7th century BCE](https://www.bsw.org/biblica/vol-87-2006/tyre-s-70-years-in-isaiah-23-15-18/115/), possibly to reinterpret the original prophecy after it had not come to pass as expected. This type of editorial updating is a recognized feature in ancient prophetic texts.
*   **Ambiguity of "Rebuilt":** The Hebrew verb in Ezekiel 26:14 is ambiguous. The form is identical for the second-person masculine singular ("**you** shall not be rebuilt") and the third-person feminine singular ("**she** shall not be rebuilt"). While many English versions choose a rendering that refers to the city ("she"), the Septuagint (the ancient Greek translation) and other versions render it as "you." This opens the possibility that the prophecy was directed at the *king* of Tyre, meaning his dynasty would end, rather than the physical city being permanently obliterated ([a point acknowledged in biblical archaeology scholarship](https://biblearchaeology.org/research/divided-kingdom/3304-ezekiel-26114-a-proof-text-for-inerrancy-or-fallibility-of-the-old-testament)).

## Conclusion

The prophecies against Tyre remain a subject of intense debate. One view holds that the combined actions of Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander the Great fulfilled the prophecies in a literal, multi-stage judgment. Another view contends that the prophecies failed in their specifics, pointing to Nebuchadnezzar's inability to conquer the island and the city's continuous existence to this day. A third perspective, informed by textual criticism, suggests that the prophecies themselves were edited and reinterpreted over time by ancient scribes.

Each interpretation relies on a different reading of the historical and textual evidence, making the fall of Tyre a complex and fascinating case study in the fulfillment of biblical prophecy.
