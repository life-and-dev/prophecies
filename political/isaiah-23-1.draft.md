# The Judgment and Restoration of Tyre

## Prophecy

Isaiah predicted the destruction of the wealthy Phoenician port city of Tyre.

> Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for **Tyre is laid waste**, without house or harbor! — Isaiah 23:1 (ESV)

A later section specifies a 70-year period of being forgotten, followed by a return to commerce.

> **Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years**... At the end of seventy years, the LORD will visit Tyre, and **she will return to her wages** and will prostitute herself with all the kingdoms of the world. — Isaiah 23:15-17 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Biblical View

The prophet **Ezekiel** delivered a much more detailed prophecy against Tyre (Ezekiel 26-28) shortly before its siege by Nebuchadnezzar. He predicted:
*   Nebuchadnezzar would destroy the mainland city of Tyre (Ezekiel 26:7-11).
*   "Many nations" would come against the city, like waves of the sea (Ezekiel 26:3).
*   They would "scrape her dust from her and make her a bare rock" (Ezekiel 26:4).
*   Her stones, timber, and soil would be laid "in the midst of the water" (Ezekiel 26:12).
*   The city would become a place for the spreading of nets and would "never be rebuilt" (Ezekiel 26:14).

Ezekiel later acknowledges that Nebuchadnezzar did not receive his wages for the long siege, and would be compensated by plundering Egypt instead (Ezekiel 29:18-20). This confirms the historical difficulty of the first siege but does not negate the broader prophecy of destruction.

### Historic View

The prophecies against Tyre were fulfilled in two main stages by two different conquerors, matching the "many nations" prediction:

1.  **Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon** besieged mainland Tyre for 13 years (586-573 BCE). He destroyed the mainland city ("Old Tyre"), but the inhabitants moved their wealth to their heavily fortified island fortress about half a mile offshore. This is why Ezekiel 29 notes that Nebuchadnezzar "got no wages" from the campaign.

2.  **Alexander the Great** conquered the island city in 332 BCE. To reach the island, his army built a massive 200-foot-wide causeway. To do so, he **scraped up the rubble, stones, timber, and even the soil of the destroyed mainland city** and threw it into the sea to build the land bridge. This action literally fulfilled Ezekiel's prophecy to "scrape her dust from her" and lay her stones "in the midst of the water."

The ancient island city was destroyed. While a new city was later built on the site (modern Sur, Lebanon), the original Phoenician city-state, the "queen of the seas," was never rebuilt to its former glory, fulfilling the prophecy that it would "be built no more."

### Scholarly Analysis

The fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy, particularly the "70 years" detail (Isaiah 23:15-17), presents interpretive challenges.

*   **The "70 Years" Prophecy:** Tyre was never completely abandoned for a literal 70-year period. Conservative scholars often interpret this number symbolically, representing the period of Babylonian dominance in the region (c. 609-539 BCE), during which Tyre's commercial power was eclipsed.
*   **Textual Criticism:** Some scholars, like [Mark Leuchter](https://www.bsw.org/biblica/vol-87-2006/tyre-s-70-years-in-isaiah-23-15-18/115/) and [Jongkyung Lee](https://academic.oup.com/book/6793), argue that verses 15-18 were a later addition to the text by a different author. They suggest this section was added to reinterpret the original, more absolute prophecy of destruction (vv. 1-14) after it became clear that Tyre had survived the initial Assyrian and Babylonian threats.

## Conclusion

The prophecies against Tyre, particularly when combining the accounts of Isaiah and Ezekiel, show a remarkable pattern of historical fulfillment. The two-stage destruction by Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander the Great aligns closely with the specific details of Ezekiel's oracle, including the scraping of the mainland city's debris into the sea. While scholarly debate continues regarding the interpretation of Isaiah's "70 years" and the textual history of the chapter, the ultimate fall of the Phoenician sea power and the unique method of its destruction serve as powerful evidence for the prophets' foresight.
