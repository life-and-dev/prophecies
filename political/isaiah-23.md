# Isaiah 23 (Tyre)

The prophecy in Isaiah 23 foretells the downfall of the Phoenician port city of Tyre, a major commercial power in the ancient world. The chapter's interpretation is complex, involving historical analysis and significant scholarly debate over its composition and fulfillment.

## The Prophecy

The oracle begins with a declaration of Tyre's destruction:
> "Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for Tyre is laid waste, without house or harbor!" — Isaiah 23:1 (ESV)

The prophecy concludes with a specific temporal element and a prediction of restoration:
> "Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, like the days of one king. At the end of seventy years, it will happen to Tyre as in the song of the prostitute... At the end of seventy years, the LORD will visit Tyre, and she will return to her wages." — Isaiah 23:15, 17 (ESV)

## Historical Record

The historical record, confirmed by secular historians, shows that Tyre faced two major sieges that significantly impacted its power and sovereignty.

1.  **Siege by Nebuchadnezzar II of Babylon (586–573 BCE):** This 13-year siege ended not in a destructive conquest, but in a [negotiated settlement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siege_of_Tyre_(586%E2%80%93573_BC)). The island city of Tyre was not breached, and it became a vassal to Babylon without being plundered.
2.  **Siege by Alexander the Great (332 BCE):** Centuries later, Alexander conquered the island city after a brutal seven-month siege, famously building a causeway from the mainland to the island. This event was catastrophic for the city, resulting in [mass slaughter and enslavement](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/107/alexanders-siege-of-tyre-332-bce/).

## Biblical View

The prophet Ezekiel also delivered a detailed oracle against Tyre, which provides a parallel account of God's judgment. His prophecy, found in [Ezekiel 26](political/ezekiel-26-1.draft.md), gives a multi-stage prediction of destruction that many scholars connect to the historical sieges by both Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander the Great. While Isaiah's prophecy is more general, Ezekiel provides specific details that complement and expand upon the theme of Tyre's fall.

## Critics' View

This view, common in critical scholarship, argues that the prophecy was not fulfilled as originally intended and was subsequently edited.
*   **Failed Prediction:** The initial oracle (Isaiah 23:1-14) appears to predict an imminent and total destruction that did not happen during the Assyrian or Babylonian periods.
*   **Later Addition:** Many scholars believe that verses 15-18 (the "70 years" section) were a [later scribal addition](https://www.bsw.org/biblica/vol-87-2006/tyre-s-70-years-in-isaiah-23-15-18/115/). According to this theory, a later editor, writing when it was clear that Tyre had survived, added the passage to re-interpret the original prophecy. This turned an absolute prediction of doom into a temporary judgment, thus reconciling the prophecy with the historical reality. This kind of editorial reinterpretation, known as redaction, is a recognized feature in the formation of biblical texts, as argued in scholarly works like [Jongkyung Lee's redactional study](https://www.betterworldbooks.com/product/detail/a-redactional-study-of-the-book-of-isaiah-13-23-9780198816768).

## Christian View

This view argues that Isaiah's prophecy was fulfilled, but not in a strictly literal sense.
*   **"Laid Waste":** This is seen as a prophecy of the city's loss of commercial power and independence, rather than its immediate physical obliteration. The sieges by major empires effectively ended Tyre's dominance as a sea power.
*   **"70 Years":** This is interpreted as a symbolic number representing a long period of subjugation, not a literal 70-year abandonment. Often, this period is linked to the era of Babylonian dominance (c. 609-539 BCE), during which Tyre's influence waned. After the fall of Babylon, Tyre passed to Persian control and eventually began to recover its commercial strength, fitting the prophecy of a "return to her wages."

## Manuscript Analysis

A comparison of the Masoretic Text (MT) and the Septuagint (LXX) for Isaiah 23 does not reveal significant textual variants that fundamentally change the prophecy or its interpretation. Both manuscript traditions contain the core predictions of Tyre's destruction and the "70 years" of being forgotten. Unlike the prophecy in Ezekiel, the debate over Isaiah 23 centers more on the historical interpretation and the theory of later redaction rather than on differences between ancient manuscripts.

## Conclusion

The fulfillment of Isaiah 23 is highly debated. The **Christian View** maintains that the prophecy was fulfilled, interpreting its terms symbolically: the "destruction" of Tyre refers to its loss of sovereignty and commercial power, and the "70 years" represents the period of Babylonian dominance. In sharp contrast, the **Critics' View** argues that the prophecy failed to predict events literally and that the text was subsequently altered. This view is based on the historical fact that Tyre was never completely abandoned and on textual studies suggesting the "70 years" passage was a later addition to explain away the unfulfilled prediction. The core of the disagreement rests on whether the prophecy must be interpreted literally or can be understood symbolically.
