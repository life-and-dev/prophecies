# The Fall of Samaria (Ephraim)

## Prophecy

Isaiah predicted the imminent fall of the Northern Kingdom (Ephraim/Samaria), describing its glory as a "fading flower" that would be swiftly consumed.

> "Ah, the proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim, and the fading flower of its glorious beauty... Behold, the Lord has one who is mighty and strong; like a storm of hail, a destroying tempest... he will hurl it down to the earth with his hand. The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim will be trodden underfoot; and the fading flower of its glorious beauty... will be like a first-ripe fig before the summer: when someone sees it, he swallows it as soon as it is in his hand." — Isaiah 28:1-4 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic View

This prophecy was fulfilled in **722 BCE**, shortly after Isaiah delivered it. The Assyrian king **Sargon II** (and his predecessor Shalmaneser V) besieged and destroyed Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom. The Assyrians deported the population, effectively ending Ephraim as a political entity and fulfilling the prediction that the "flower" would be trampled. [The historical details surrounding the fall of Samaria are complex](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdf/10.1086/473509), with both Shalmaneser V (in the biblical account) and Sargon II (in his own annals) claiming credit for the final conquest.

## Conclusion

The swift and total collapse of the Northern Kingdom of Israel at the hands of the Assyrians serves as a direct fulfillment of Isaiah's prophecy.
