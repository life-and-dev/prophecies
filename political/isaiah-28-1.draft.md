# The Destruction of Ephraim

## Prophecy

Isaiah predicted the imminent fall of the Northern Kingdom (Ephraim/Samaria), describing it poetically as a fading flower that would be trampled.

> "The proud crown of the drunkards of Ephraim, and the fading flower of its glorious beauty... Behold, the Lord has one who is mighty and strong; like a storm of hail... he will cast down to the earth with his hand." — Isaiah 28:1-2 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic View

This prophecy was fulfilled in **722 BCE**, shortly after Isaiah delivered it. The Assyrian king **Sargon II** (and his predecessor Shalmaneser V) besieged and destroyed Samaria, the capital of the Northern Kingdom. The Assyrians deported the population, effectively ending Ephraim as a political entity and fulfilling the prediction that the "flower" would be trampled. The [historical details](https://brill.com/display/title/2260) surrounding the fall of Samaria are complex, with both Shalmaneser V and Sargon II claiming credit for the conquest.

## Conclusion

**Historic fulfillment**

The complete destruction of the Northern Kingdom by Assyria is a confirmed historical fact that occurred precisely as Isaiah warned.
