# The Useless Alliance

## Prophecy

Isaiah warned King Hezekiah against forming an alliance with Egypt, predicting that "Rahab" (Egypt) would sit idle and provide no help against the Assyrians.

> "For Egypt's help is worthless and empty; therefore I have called her 'Rahab who sits still.'" — Isaiah 30:7 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic View

Historical records confirm that despite Hezekiah's tribute and appeals to Egypt, the Egyptian army was defeated by Sennacherib at the **Battle of Eltekeh**, and they failed to prevent the siege of Jerusalem. The city was ultimately saved by divine intervention (the death of 185,000 Assyrians), not by the Egyptian alliance, proving Isaiah's political assessment correct.

## Conclusion

**Historic fulfillment**

The failure of the Egyptian alliance to protect Judah from Assyria confirmed the prophet's warning.
