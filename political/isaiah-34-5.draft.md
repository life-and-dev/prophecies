# The Desolation of Edom

## Prophecy

Isaiah predicted a complete and perpetual desolation for the land of Edom (modern southern Jordan), describing it as a place abandoned to wild animals forever.

> "For my sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; behold, it descends for judgment upon Edom... Her land shall become burning pitch. Night and day it shall not be quenched; its smoke shall go up forever. From generation to generation it shall lie waste; none shall pass through it forever and ever. But the hawk and the porcupine shall possess it, the owl and the raven shall dwell in it... and thorns shall grow over its strongholds, nettles and thistles in its fortresses. It shall be the haunt of jackals, an abode for ostriches." — Isaiah 34:5, 9-11, 13 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic View

The nation of Edom was eventually [driven out of their territory by nomadic tribes, most notably the Nabataeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edom#Classical_antiquity) (who built Petra). The displaced Edomites were forced westward into southern Judah, a region that became known as Idumea. After supporting the Jewish revolt against the Romans, the Edomites/Idumeans were destroyed and disappeared from history as a distinct people after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Their ancient heartland eventually became a desolate waste, inhabited only by wild animals and nomads for centuries, exactly as described.

## Conclusion

The historical disappearance of the Edomite people and the long-term desolation of their original homeland align with the vivid and permanent judgment prophesied by Isaiah.
