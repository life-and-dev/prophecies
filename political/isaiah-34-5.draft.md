# The Doom of Edom

## Prophecy

Isaiah predicted a perpetual desolation for the land of Edom (modern southern Jordan).

> "For my sword has drunk its fill in the heavens; behold, it descends for judgment upon Edom... It shall lie waste; from generation to generation none shall pass through it." — Isaiah 34:5, 10 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic View

The nation of Edom was eventually driven out of their territory by the Nabataeans (who built Petra) and later disappeared entirely from history as a distinct people after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Their ancient heartland eventually became a desolate waste, inhabited only by wild animals and nomads for centuries, exactly as described.

## Conclusion

**Historic fulfillment**

The complete disappearance of the Edomite nation and the long-term desolation of their territory confirms the biblical judgment pronounced against them.
