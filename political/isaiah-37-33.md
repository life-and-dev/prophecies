# Isaiah 37:33-35 (Sennacherib's Failure)

## Prophecy

During the reign of King Hezekiah, the Assyrian Empire was the dominant world power, having already destroyed the Northern Kingdom of Israel. As King Sennacherib surrounded Jerusalem with an overwhelming force, [Isaiah prophesied that the king would not even enter the city or launch an attack against it](https://ofgod.info/calling/hezekiah).

> Therefore thus says the LORD concerning the king of Assyria: **He shall not come into this city or shoot an arrow there**, or come before it with a shield or **cast up a siege mound against it**. By the way that he came, by the same he shall return, and **he shall not come into this city**, declares the LORD. For I will defend this city to save it, for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David. — Isaiah 37:33-35 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

This prophecy is one of the most well-attested events in biblical history, confirmed by both the biblical narrative and secular Assyrian records.

### Biblical Account

According to 2 Kings 19:35-36, the Assyrian army suffered a catastrophic loss (185,000 soldiers died in one night, attributed to the angel of the Lord), forcing Sennacherib to retreat immediately to his capital, Nineveh, without conquering Jerusalem.

### Secular History (Sennacherib's Annals)

The [Taylor Prism](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W_1855-1003-1), a clay hexagonal prism discovered in Nineveh, contains Sennacherib's own account of his campaign. In it, he boasts of conquering 46 of Hezekiah's strong cities and driving out over 200,000 people. However, regarding Jerusalem, his boast changes significantly:

> "As for Hezekiah the Judahite... **himself I shut up in Jerusalem his royal city, like a bird in a cage**." — *Sennacherib's Annals*

Crucially, Sennacherib **does not claim to have captured Jerusalem**, entered the city, or deposed Hezekiah. This is a stunning admission by silence, as Assyrian kings famously exaggerated their victories and never omitted a conquest. His claim of shutting Hezekiah up "like a bird in a cage" confirms he surrounded the city but failed to take it, exactly as Isaiah predicted: "He shall not come into this city."

## Conclusion

The primary prediction—that the Assyrian king would fail to enter Jerusalem despite his superior military force—was literally fulfilled. Both the Bible and Sennacherib's own records agree that the siege ended with Hezekiah still on the throne and Jerusalem unconquered, a unique anomaly in Sennacherib's otherwise victorious campaign.
