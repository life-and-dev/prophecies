# The Sun's Shadow Going Backward

## Prophecy

God gave King Hezekiah a miraculous sign to confirm he would be healed and the city delivered.

> "Behold, I will make the shadow cast by the declining sun on the dial of Ahaz turn back ten steps." So the sun turned back on the dial the ten steps by which it had declined. — Isaiah 38:8 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic View

The biblical narrative in **2 Kings 20:11** and **2 Chronicles 32:31** records this event as a historical occurrence. 2 Chronicles notes that envoys from Babylon came to inquire about "the sign that had been done in the land," suggesting the phenomenon was observed or heard of internationally.

**Conservative Explanations:**
*   **Divine Miracle:** God temporarily altered the earth's rotation or the position of the sun.
*   **Localized Phenomenon:** God caused a miraculous atmospheric refraction (bending of light) that affected the shadow on the dial without disrupting cosmic mechanics.
*   **Phenomenological Language:** The text describes what was observed (the shadow moving), not the scientific mechanism.

**Critical Scholarly View:**
Critical scholars suggest several naturalistic or literary explanations:
*   **Optical Illusion:** An unusual atmospheric event (like a mock sun or cloud effect) created the appearance of the shadow reversing.
*   **Mechanical Issue:** A malfunction or misreading of the sundial mechanism.
*   **Legendary Accretion:** The account may be a later legendary addition to emphasize the significance of Hezekiah's healing, common in ancient Near Eastern royal narratives.

## Conclusion

**Biblical fulfillment**

For the biblical writers and the original audience, this was a historically fulfilled sign that confirmed God's promise to Hezekiah. Whether explained as a suspension of natural laws, a unique optical event, or a literary device, the text presents it as an event that actually occurred in Hezekiah's time.
