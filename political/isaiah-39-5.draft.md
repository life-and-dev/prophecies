# The Exile to Babylon

## Prophecy

After King Hezekiah foolishly showed his treasures to Babylonian envoys, Isaiah prophesied that everything would eventually be carried off to Babylon—a prediction made when Babylon was not yet the dominant world power.

> "Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in your house... shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, says the LORD. And some of your own sons... shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon." — Isaiah 39:6-7 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic View

This prophecy was literally fulfilled in **586 BCE** (over 100 years later) when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon conquered Jerusalem.
*   **Treasures:** He looted the temple and palace treasures (2 Kings 25:13-17).
*   **Descendants:** He took the royal family and nobility into captivity. Daniel and his friends (Hananiah, Mishael, Azariah) were of royal lineage and served in the palace of the king of Babylon (Daniel 1:3-6), likely as eunuchs.

## Conclusion

**Historic fulfillment**

The prophecy accurately predicted the specific destination of the exile (Babylon) and the fate of the royal line long before the geopolitical situation made such an event seem likely.
