# The Exile to Babylon

A moment of pride, a costly mistake. King Hezekiah's decision to reveal his kingdom's treasures to Babylonian envoys set in motion a prophecy that would unfold over the next century. This article explores Isaiah's stunning prediction and its eventual, precise fulfillment, demonstrating a remarkable instance of foreknowledge in ancient texts.

## Prophecy

After King Hezekiah foolishly showed his treasures to Babylonian envoys, Isaiah prophesied that everything would eventually be carried off to Babylon—a prediction made when Babylon was not yet the dominant world power.

> "Behold, the days are coming, when all that is in your house... shall be carried to Babylon. Nothing shall be left, says the LORD. And some of your own sons... shall be eunuchs in the palace of the king of Babylon." — Isaiah 39:6-7 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic View

This prophecy was literally fulfilled in **586 BCE** (over 100 years later) when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon conquered Jerusalem.
*   **Treasures:** He looted the temple and palace treasures (2 Kings 25:13-17).
*   **Descendants:** He took the royal family and nobility into captivity. Daniel and his friends (Hananiah, Mishael, Azariah) were of royal lineage and served in the palace of the king of Babylon (Daniel 1:3-6), likely as eunuchs.
