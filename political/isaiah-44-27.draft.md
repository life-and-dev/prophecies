# The Cyrus Prophecy

## Prophecy

In a remarkable passage, Isaiah first describes the specific military tactic that would allow Babylon to be conquered, then names **Cyrus** as God's anointed one who would rebuild Jerusalem and the temple—all prophesied long before Cyrus was born or the city was destroyed.

**The Military Strategy:**
> Who says to the deep, 'Be dry; I will dry up your rivers'... — Isaiah 44:27 (ESV)

**The Naming of Cyrus:**
> ...who says of **Cyrus**, 'He is My shepherd, and he shall fulfill all my purpose'; saying of **Jerusalem**, 'She shall be built,' and of the **temple**, 'Your foundation shall be laid.' — Isaiah 44:28 (ESV)

> Thus says the LORD to His anointed, to **Cyrus**, whose right hand I have grasped, to subdue nations before him... — Isaiah 45:1 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic View

This is one of the most specific prophecies in the Bible, combining both tactical details and precise naming in consecutive verses.

**The Strategy Fulfilled:**
The Greek historian **Herodotus** records that Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon in 539 BCE by diverting the **Euphrates River** into a marsh, lowering the water level enough for his troops to wade under the city walls and enter the city, precisely fulfilling Isaiah's description of "drying up the rivers."

**The Naming Fulfilled:**
Shortly after conquering Babylon, Cyrus issued a decree allowing Jewish exiles to return to Judah and rebuild their temple, exactly as Isaiah had prophesied.

**Biblical Record:**
> "Thus says Cyrus king of Persia... He has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem... Whoever is among you of all his people... let him go up to Jerusalem... and rebuild the house of the LORD..." — Ezra 1:2-3 (ESV)

**Secular History:**
The [Cyrus Cylinder](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W_1880-0617-1941) confirms Cyrus's general policy of returning exiled peoples and their gods to their native lands and restoring their sanctuaries, which aligns perfectly with the biblical account of his decree regarding Jerusalem.

## Conclusion

**Historic fulfillment**

The prophecy was literally and precisely fulfilled on multiple levels:
1. Cyrus conquered Babylon using the specific **military tactic** of diverting rivers (Isaiah 44:27)
2. A king named **Cyrus** arose, exactly as Isaiah predicted by name (Isaiah 44:28, 45:1)
3. He issued the command to **rebuild Jerusalem and the temple** (Isaiah 44:28)

The combination of accurately describing a specific military strategy and naming a future king over a century in advance is considered by conservative scholars as irrefutable proof of divine inspiration.
