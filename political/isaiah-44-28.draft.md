# The Cyrus Prophecy

## Prophecy

Isaiah specifically names **Cyrus** as God's shepherd and anointed one who would order the rebuilding of Jerusalem and the temple, long before Cyrus was born or the city was destroyed.

> ...who says of **Cyrus**, 'He is My shepherd, and he shall fulfill all my purpose'; saying of **Jerusalem**, 'She shall be built,' and of the **temple**, 'Your foundation shall be laid.' — Isaiah 44:28 (ESV)

> Thus says the LORD to His anointed, to **Cyrus**, whose right hand I have grasped, to subdue nations before him... — Isaiah 45:1 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic View

This is one of the most specific prophecies in the Bible. Cyrus the Great, King of Persia, conquered Babylon in 539 BCE. Shortly after, he issued a decree allowing Jewish exiles to return to Judah and rebuild their temple.

**Biblical Record:**
> "Thus says Cyrus king of Persia... He has charged me to build him a house at Jerusalem... Whoever is among you of all his people... let him go up to Jerusalem... and rebuild the house of the LORD..." — Ezra 1:2-3 (ESV)

**Secular History:**
The [Cyrus Cylinder](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W_1880-0617-1941) confirms Cyrus's general policy of returning exiled peoples and their gods to their native lands and restoring their sanctuaries, which aligns perfectly with the biblical account of his decree regarding Jerusalem.

## Conclusion

**Historic fulfillment**

The prophecy was literally and precisely fulfilled. A king named Cyrus arose, conquered Babylon, and issued the specific command to rebuild Jerusalem and the temple, exactly as Isaiah predicted. The mention of his name over a century in advance is considered by conservative scholars as irrefutable proof of divine inspiration.
