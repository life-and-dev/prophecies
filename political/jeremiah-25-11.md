# Jeremiah 25:11-12 (Babylonian Dominance)

## Prophecy

> “This whole land shall become a ruin and a waste, and **these nations shall serve the king of Babylon seventy years**. Then after seventy years are completed, **I will punish the king of Babylon** and that nation, the land of the Chaldeans, for their iniquity, declares the **LORD**, making the land an everlasting waste.” — Jeremiah 25:11-12 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

The [Battle of Carchemish](https://www.worldhistory.org/Battle_of_Carchemish/) in 605 BCE marked Babylon's decisive victory over Egypt and established its dominance over the region. Babylonian imperial power lasted approximately 70 years until 539 BCE when [Cyrus the Great conquered Babylon](https://www.worldhistory.org/article/1698/fall-of-babylon/), fulfilling the prediction that God would "punish the king of Babylon."

**Timeline:**
*   **609 BCE**: Fall of Assyria; Babylon rises as regional power.
*   **605 BCE**: Battle of Carchemish; Babylonian dominance established.
*   **539 BCE**: Fall of Babylon to Cyrus the Great.
*   **Duration**: Approximately 70 years (609–539 BCE or 605–539 BCE).

The [Nabonidus Chronicle](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/mesopotamian-chronicles-content/abc-7-nabonidus-chronicle/) documents Cyrus's conquest in 539 BCE, confirming the end of the Babylonian empire exactly as prophesied.

The prophecy correctly predicted the duration of the Neo-Babylonian Empire's supremacy over the nations, lasting approximately 70 years from its rise (approx. 609/605 BCE) to its fall (539 BCE), ending with the punishment of the Babylonian king by Cyrus.
