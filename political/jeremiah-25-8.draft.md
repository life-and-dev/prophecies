# The Fall of Jerusalem

## Prophecy

> “Therefore thus says the **LORD** of hosts: Because you have not obeyed my words... I will bring them against this land and its inhabitants, and against all these surrounding nations. I will **devote them to destruction**, and make them a **horror**, a **hissing**, and an **everlasting desolation**.” — Jeremiah 25:8-9 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic

In 586 BCE, after a prolonged siege, the Babylonian army breached the walls of Jerusalem. They burned the Temple of Solomon, destroyed the royal palace, and razed the city walls, just as Jeremiah had predicted decades earlier. The destruction was absolute, leaving the city in ruins and the population exiled or scattered.

## Conclusion

**Historic fulfillment**

The prophecy was literally fulfilled in 586 BCE with the total destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple by the Babylonians, an event confirmed by archaeology and historical records.
