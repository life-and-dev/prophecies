# Seventy Years Until Jewish Restoration

## Prophecy

> “For thus says the **LORD**: When **seventy years are completed for Babylon**, I will visit you, and I will fulfill to you my promise and **bring you back to this place**.” — Jeremiah 29:10 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic

This prophecy was fulfilled through the return of Jewish exiles following the decree of Cyrus the Great. The book of Ezra explicit links this event to Jeremiah's words:

> “In the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, **that the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled**... he made a proclamation... ‘Whoever is among you of all his people... **let him go up to Jerusalem**... and **rebuild the house of the LORD**.’” — Ezra 1:1-3 (ESV)

Historians and theologians identify two periods that align with the seventy-year timeline:

1.  **Exile Duration (605–536 BCE)**: From the first deportation (Daniel taken) to the first return under Zerubbabel.
2.  **Temple Desolation (586–516 BCE)**: From the destruction of Solomon's Temple to the completion of the Second Temple.

The [Cyrus Cylinder](https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/object/W_1880-0617-1941) provides archaeological confirmation of Cyrus's policy allowing displaced peoples to return home and rebuild their sanctuaries, corroborating the biblical account.

### Biblical

The prophet Daniel explicitly refers to this prophecy in Daniel 9:2, stating that he "perceived in the books the number of years that, according to the word of the **LORD** to Jeremiah the prophet, must pass before the end of the desolations of Jerusalem, namely, seventy years."

## Conclusion

**Historic fulfillment**

The prophecy was fulfilled when Cyrus the Great issued the decree allowing the Jews to return to Jerusalem, ending the Babylonian exile exactly within the prophesied seventy-year timeframe (whether calculated from the first deportation or the temple's destruction).
