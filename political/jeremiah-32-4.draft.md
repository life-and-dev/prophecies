# The Fate of King Zedekiah

## Prophecy

> “Zedekiah king of Judah shall not escape out of the hand of the Chaldeans, but shall **surely be given** into the hand of the king of Babylon, and shall **speak with him face to face and see him eye to eye**. And he shall **take Zedekiah to Babylon**, and there he shall remain until I visit him, declares the **LORD**.” — Jeremiah 32:4-5 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic

The prophecy was fulfilled with precise detail. After fleeing Jerusalem, Zedekiah was captured near Jericho and brought to Nebuchadnezzar at Riblah.
*   **"Speak with him face to face"**: 2 Kings 25:6 records that they "brought him up to the king of Babylon at Riblah, who passed sentence on him."
*   **"See him eye to eye"**: Zedekiah saw Nebuchadnezzar before being blinded.
*   **"Take Zedekiah to Babylon"**: After witnessing the execution of his sons, Zedekiah was blinded, bound in bronze fetters, and taken to Babylon, where he died in prison (Jeremiah 52:10-11).

This fulfillment harmonizes with Ezekiel's seemingly contradictory prophecy that Zedekiah would go to Babylon but "not see it" (Ezekiel 12:13) — he was blinded before he arrived.

## Conclusion

**Historic fulfillment**

Every detail of the prophecy was historically fulfilled: Zedekiah was captured, saw Nebuchadnezzar face-to-face for judgment, and was physically taken to Babylon.
