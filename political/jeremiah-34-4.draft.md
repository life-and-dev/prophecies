# Zedekiah's Peaceful Death

## Prophecy

> “Yet hear the word of the **LORD**, O Zedekiah king of Judah! Thus says the **LORD** concerning you: ‘You shall not die by the sword. You shall **die in peace**. And as **spices were burned for your fathers**, the former kings who were before you, so people shall **burn spices for you** and **lament for you**, saying, “Alas, lord!”’ For I have spoken the word, declares the **LORD**.” — Jeremiah 34:4-5 (ESV)

## Textual Variants

The Masoretic Text (MT) and Septuagint (LXX) differ significantly in the description of the funeral honors, which affects the assessment of fulfillment.

| Text | Word | Translation |
|---|---|---|
| **Masoretic Text** (Hebrew) | שְׂרֵפָה (*serephah*) | "Burn spices" or "burning" |
| **Septuagint** (Greek) | κλαύσονται (*klausontai*) | "They shall weep" |

The [Septuagint](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Septuagint) lacks the specific reference to the ceremonial burning of spices, predicting only that people would "weep" for him.

## Fulfillment

### Critical

Critics argue this prophecy failed or was conditional on an obedience that did not happen (Jeremiah 34:8-22). Historically, Zedekiah did not have a "peaceful" end:
*   He witnessed the execution of his sons.
*   He was blinded.
*   He was chained and imprisoned in Babylon until his death (Jeremiah 52:10-11).
*   There is no record of honorable burial or spices being burned for him in Babylon.

### Conservative

Conservative scholars argue for a technical or spiritual fulfillment:
*   **"Die in peace"**: He was not executed ("die by the sword") like his sons but died of natural causes, which is technically a "peaceful" death compared to violent execution. It may also imply he died reconciled with God.
*   **"Lament for you"**: Even in captivity, his people likely mourned the death of the last Davidic king. The LXX version ("they shall weep") is easier to accept as fulfilled than the MT's specific "burning of spices."

## Conclusion

**Debatable fulfillment**

The fulfillment is debatable. While Zedekiah avoided immediate execution (dying "by the sword"), his death in a Babylonian prison after being blinded and seeing his sons killed strains the natural meaning of "dying in peace." The literal fulfillment of the funeral honors (burning spices) is historically unverified, though the LXX variant (weeping) is plausible.
