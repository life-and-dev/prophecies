# The Battle of Carchemish

## Prophecy

> “Concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, which was by the river Euphrates at Carchemish and which Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon **defeated** in the fourth year of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah, king of Judah...” — Jeremiah 46:2 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Historic

The [Battle of Carchemish](https://www.worldhistory.org/Battle_of_Carchemish/) in 605 BCE occurred exactly as identified in the prophecy. Nebuchadnezzar II decisively defeated Pharaoh Necho II's forces, an event that ended Egypt's regional power and established the Neo-Babylonian Empire. The [Babylonian Chronicle](https://www.livius.org/sources/content/mesopotamian-chronicles-content/abc-5-jerusalem-chronicle/) provides contemporary cuneiform evidence documenting this specific victory.

## Conclusion

**Historic fulfillment**

The prophecy accurately identified the combatants (Egypt vs. Babylon), the location (Carchemish), and the outcome (Babylonian victory), all of which are confirmed by secular history.
