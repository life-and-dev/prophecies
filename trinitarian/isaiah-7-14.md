# Isaiah 7:14 (Virgin Birth)

## Prophecy

> "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Behold, the **virgin** shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name **Immanuel**." — Isaiah 7:14 (ESV)

## Meaning of Immanuel

The name **Immanuel** (עִמָּנוּ אֵל) translates to "**God is with us**." The interpretation of this name is a central point of divergence between Christian and Jewish theology.

### Trinitarian View (Ontological)
Christians, particularly [Trinitarians](https://son.ofgod.info/trinity), interpret "God with us" as a literal description of Jesus' nature. They believe [Jesus was fully God and fully man](https://son.ofgod.info/son-as-god). Therefore, the name is not just symbolic but descriptive of the reality that in Jesus, God has physically entered human history to dwell among His people.

### Unitarian View (Manifestational)
Non-Trinitarian Christians (such as Biblical Unitarians) view the name "Immanuel" as indicating **God's action through Jesus**, rather than Jesus' identity as God. In this view, "God with us" means that God has not abandoned his people but is actively saving and redeeming them *by means of* his human Messiah, Jesus. The name is seen as symbolic (like "Elijah" meaning "My God is Yahweh"), affirming that in Jesus' life and ministry, God was perfectly represented and powerfully present, "reconciling the world to Himself" (2 Corinthians 5:18-19).

### Jewish View (Theophoric)
Jewish scholars interpret the name as a **theophoric name**, which was common in biblical times (e.g., *Daniel* means "God is my Judge," *Elijah* means "The LORD is my God"). In this view, the name does not imply the child *is* God. Instead, it serves as a sign to King Ahaz that **God is on our side** or "God is supporting us" against the invading armies of Syria and Ephraim. The child's presence would be a living reminder that God had not abandoned Judah during the crisis.

## Textual Variants

The Hebrew word used for "virgin" is **עַלְמָה** (*almah*), which can mean either "young woman" or "virgin." However, the [Septuagint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Septuagint) (the ancient Greek translation of the Old Testament) translated it as **παρθένος** (*parthenos*), which specifically means "virgin."

This translation choice in the Septuagint is significant because the Gospel of Matthew quotes the Greek version when applying the prophecy to Jesus.

This isn't strictly a textual variant (the Hebrew is the same), but it represents an early interpretive translation that profoundly influenced Christian reading of the text.

## Fulfillment

### Jews

Jewish scholars interpret this passage in its immediate historical context during the [Syro-Ephraimite War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syro-Ephraimite_War) (c. 735 BCE), when King Pekah of Israel and King Rezin of Damascus threatened to depose King Ahaz of Judah. The "sign" was given to assure Ahaz that God would protect Jerusalem from this alliance.

#### The Definite Article

The Hebrew text uses "**ha-almah**" (הָעַלְמָה) — "**the** young woman," not "a young woman." This definite article indicates Isaiah was pointing to a **specific, identifiable woman** that both he and Ahaz could see or knew about at that moment. The use of "the" suggests the woman was present or immediately known to both parties, making the sign concrete and verifiable. ([Source: Jews for Judaism](https://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/isaiah-714-a-virgin-birth/), [What Jews Believe](https://whatjewsbelieve.org/isaiah-714/))

#### The Verb Tense

The Hebrew word "**harah**" (הָרָה) is an adjective (or participle) meaning "**pregnant**" or "with child," acting as a present-state description rather than a future verb. It is best translated as "is pregnant" or "is with child." This indicates the young woman was **already pregnant** when Isaiah spoke, making the timeline immediate and measurable rather than distant.

#### Identity: Isaiah's Wife or Ahaz's Wife

Jewish scholars generally propose two main candidates for the identity of "the young woman":

1.  **Isaiah's Wife:** Many commentators (like Rashi and Ibn Ezra) identify her as Isaiah's wife, "the prophetess" mentioned in Isaiah 8:3. The birth of her son, Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz, follows the same timeline formula as the Immanuel prophecy ("Before the boy knows how to cry 'My father'..."), suggesting they are the same event. ([Source: Outreach Judaism](https://outreachjudaism.org/dual-prophecy-virgin-birth/))

2.  **King Ahaz's Wife:** Other commentators (like Kimchi/Radak) suggest she is King Ahaz's wife (Queen Abijah), and the child is the future **King Hezekiah**. In this view, Hezekiah—who would grow up to be a righteous king—personifies "God is with us" by saving Judah from destruction. The sign assured Ahaz that his royal line would continue despite the current threat. ([Source: Jews for Judaism](https://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/isaiah-714-a-virgin-birth/), [Source: Aish.com](https://aish.com/isaiah-714-a-virgin-birth/))

#### The Sign's Mechanism

The significance of the sign is not the **method** of conception (virginity), but the **timeline** it establishes. Isaiah was saying: "**This specific woman** (my wife), who is already pregnant, will soon give birth. Before **that child** reaches age 2-3 (when children distinguish right from wrong and recognize parents), your enemies will be destroyed." The name "Immanuel" ("God is with us") signified God's protective presence during the crisis, not necessarily the child's literal name.

The sign's verses continue: "For before the boy knows how to refuse the evil and choose the good, the land whose two kings you dread will be deserted" (Isaiah 7:16). This created a **verifiable, time-bound prediction**: watch this specific child grow, and within 2-3 years, the threat will be eliminated. ([Source: Jews for Judaism](https://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/isaiah-714-a-virgin-birth/))

#### Why It Matters to Ahaz

Because "the young woman" was present, identifiable (Isaiah's pregnant wife), and the pregnancy already underway, King Ahaz could:
1. See the specific woman Isaiah referenced
2. Track the birth of that specific child
3. Measure the 2-3 year countdown to his enemies' defeat
4. Verify the prophecy's fulfillment in his own lifetime

A prophecy about a virgin birth 700 years in the future would have provided no comfort or verification to a king facing immediate military invasion. ([Source: What Jews Believe](https://whatjewsbelieve.org/isaiah-714/))

#### Biblical Confirmation of Historical Fulfillment

The historical record in the books of Kings confirms that the prophecy was fulfilled exactly as Isaiah predicted. Within the short timeframe of a young child's development (Isaiah 7:16), the two kings threatening Ahaz were defeated:

1.  **Death of Rezin (Syria):** "The king of Assyria listened to him [Ahaz]. The king of Assyria marched up against Damascus and took it, carrying its people captive to Kir, and he killed Rezin." (2 Kings 16:9)
2.  **Defeat of Pekah (Israel):** "In the days of Pekah king of Israel, Tiglath-pileser king of Assyria came and captured... Galilee... and he carried the people captive to Assyria. Then Hoshea... conspired against Pekah... and struck him down and put him to death." (2 Kings 15:29-30)

These events occurred around 732 BCE, just a few years after Isaiah's prophecy (c. 735 BCE), validating the sign given to Ahaz.

### Christian

Christians believe this prophecy was ultimately fulfilled in the birth of Jesus Christ. The Apostle Matthew explicitly cites this verse:

> "All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: 'Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel' (which means, God with us)." — Matthew 1:22-23 (ESV)

Christians argue that while there may have been a partial fulfillment in Ahaz's time, the specific language of "virgin" (as preserved in the Septuagint) and the name "Immanuel" point to what they believe was a miraculous event—the virgin birth of Jesus, whom Christian theology identifies as God incarnate (the Incarnation).

## Textual Variants in the Gospels

A common question is whether the virgin birth narratives in the Gospels were added by later scribes ("tampering") to align with the Septuagint's translation of Isaiah.

### Matthew 1:16
The most significant textual variant occurs in Matthew's genealogy.
*   **Standard Greek Text:** "...Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ." This standard reading supports the virgin birth by breaking the pattern of "X begat Y."
*   **Sinaitic Syriac (Syrˢⁱⁿ):** This 4th/5th-century manuscript reads: "...Joseph, to whom was betrothed Mary the virgin, **begat** Jesus."

Some critics argue this Syriac reading reflects an original text where Joseph was the biological father. However, scholars note that even this manuscript calls Mary "the virgin" and includes the subsequent narrative of the virgin conception (Matt 1:18-25), creating an internal contradiction if "begat" is taken literally. Most textual critics view this as a scribal error or an attempt to fix the genealogy's rhythm, rather than evidence of a non-miraculous original text. ([Source: The Text of the Gospels](http://textus-receptus.com/wiki/Matthew_1:16))

### Luke 1:34
In Luke, Mary asks, "How will this be, since I am a virgin?" (lit. "since I do not know a man"). There is **no manuscript evidence** omitting this verse. The text is remarkably stable across all ancient witnesses, suggesting that the virgin birth narrative was part of Luke's Gospel from its earliest circulation, not a later insertion. ([Source: Biblical Hermeneutics](https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/27608/what-are-the-textual-variants-for-luke-134))

## New Testament Usage

It is important to note who actually used this prophecy in the New Testament:

*   **Matthew:** The author of Matthew is the **only one** who explicitly quotes Isaiah 7:14 (Matthew 1:23) to connect Jesus' birth to the prophecy.
*   **Luke:** Luke describes the event of the virgin birth and uses the same Greek word for virgin (*parthenos*), but he does not explicitly quote the verse from Isaiah.
*   **Other apostles:** Neither Jesus nor any other apostle ever quoted Isaiah 7:14 or mentioned the virgin birth in their recorded preaching. Their focus was primarily on Jesus' death, resurrection, and lineage from David (Romans 1:3-4).

## Conclusion

The interpretation of Isaiah 7:14 depends largely on one's theological framework and whether one prioritizes the immediate historical context or a later messianic application.

* **Trinitarian View (Ontological):** Focuses on the Septuagint's use of "virgin" and Matthew's citation. It sees the prophecy as having a dual or ultimate fulfillment in the miraculous virgin birth of Jesus. "Immanuel" is interpreted literally: Jesus *is* God incarnate dwelling among humanity.
* **Jewish View (Historical):** Focuses on the immediate crisis of 735 BCE. The "sign" was a natural pregnancy of a woman known to King Ahaz (likely his wife or Isaiah's wife). The child's birth and growth served as a visible timeline for the destruction of Judah's enemies. "Immanuel" signifies God's providential support for the nation.
* **Unitarian View (Manifestational):** Focuses on God's action *through* Jesus. Like the Jewish view, it sees "Immanuel" as a theophoric name indicating God's presence, but applies it to Jesus as the ultimate agent of God's salvation. It accepts the virgin birth narrative in Matthew/Luke but interprets the "sign" as God finally fulfilling his promises to be "with us" by sending the Messiah to save his people from sin.

Ultimately, the disagreement centers on whether the text is a proof-text for Christ's divinity, a singular historical prediction, or a typological promise of God's redeeming presence through His anointed king.
