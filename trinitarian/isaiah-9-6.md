# Isaiah 9:6 (The Child with Four Titles)

## Prophecy

> "For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called ***Wonderful Counselor***, ***Mighty God***, ***Everlasting Father***, ***Prince of Peace***." — Isaiah 9:6 (ESV)

## Contextual Reading

Isaiah 9:6 must be read within the broader narrative of Isaiah chapters 8-9, which address God's judgment and restoration of Israel during a specific historical crisis. The prophecy follows warnings about Assyrian invasion and promises of deliverance for God's people. Understanding this historical context is essential before applying the passage to messianic interpretation.

The very next verse provides crucial context:

> "Of the increase of his government and of peace there will be no end, **on the throne of David and over his kingdom**, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness from this time forth and forevermore." — Isaiah 9:7 (ESV)

This verse clarifies that the child will sit "on the throne of David and over his kingdom". This is a throne reserved for human descendants of King David. God, being eternal and sovereign over all creation, has no need to occupy David's earthly throne. The explicit reference to David's throne strongly suggests Isaiah is describing a human Davidic king, not God incarnate. This contextual detail is frequently overlooked but provides significant evidence that the prophecy originally referred to a righteous human ruler in David's line (such as King Hezekiah), rather than a declaration of divine incarnation.

**Counter-Argument**: Christians later developed the doctrine of Christ's dual nature (fully God and fully human) to address this issue. However, this theological concept was not present in Isaiah's 8th-century BC context and would have been incomprehensible to his original audience.

## Alternative Bible Translations

The Hebrew text of Isaiah 9:6 has been translated in significantly different ways across various Bible versions, demonstrating the interpretive challenges inherent in this passage:

**ESV (English Standard Version):**
> "For to us a child is born, to us a son is given; and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful Counselor, *Mighty God*, *Everlasting Father*, Prince of Peace."

**Aramaic Bible in Plain English:**
> "Because the Child is born to us, and the Son is given to us, and his authority was on his shoulder, and his Name was called The Wonder and The Counselor, *God*, *the Mighty Man of Eternity*, the Prince of Peace."

**Brenton Septuagint Translation:**
> "For a child is born to us, and a son is given to us, whose government is upon his shoulder: and his name is called *the Messenger of great counsel*"

**JPS Tanakh 1917:**
> "For a child is born unto us, A son is given unto us; And the government is upon his shoulder; And his name is called *Pele-joez-el-gibbor-Abi-ad-sar-shalom*"

The transliteration meaning is:
* Pele = Wonderful/Miracle
* Joez = Counselor/Adviser
* El-Gibbor = Mighty God
* Abi-Ad = Everlasting Father
* Sar-Shalom = Prince of Peace

Note: While the JPS 1917 translation gives all these titles to the child, [traditional Jewish interpretation](https://hermeneutics.stackexchange.com/questions/2800/should-the-title-in-isaiah-9-be-translated) (Rashi, Ibn Ezra, Kimchi) parses the grammar differently by making God (described as "Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father") the subject who names the child only "Prince of Peace."

**REV (Revised English Version):**
> "For a child will be born to us, a son will be given to us, and the government will be on his shoulders. And he will call his name Wonderful Counselor, *Mighty Hero, Father of the Coming Age*, Prince of Peace."

**The Scriptures 2009:**
> "For a child is born unto us, a son is given unto us, and the rule is on His shoulder. And His Name is called Wonder, Counsellor, *Strong Ěl*, *Father of Continuity*, Prince of Peace."

## Textual Variants

The Hebrew text of Isaiah 9:6 presents significant translation challenges, with multiple legitimate scholarly renderings of the four titles:

**Mighty God** (אֵל גִּבּוֹר, *El Gibbor*):
- Traditional: "Mighty God"
- [Martin Luther's German Bible](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luther_Bible): "Divine Hero" (*Held-Gott*)
- Alternative: "Mighty Hero" or "God of a Mighty One"

> "Although English makes a clear distinction between 'God' and 'god,' the Hebrew language, which has only capital letters, cannot. A better translation for the English reader would be 'mighty hero,' or 'divine hero.'" — [Spirit & Truth Fellowship International](https://www.biblicalunitarian.com/videos/isaiah-9-6)

**Everlasting Father** (אֲבִיעַד, *Avi-ad*):
- Traditional: "Everlasting Father"
- Alternative: "Father of the Coming Age"
- Alternative: "Father of Eternity" / "Father of Continuity"

**Wonderful Counselor** (פֶּלֶא יוֹעֵץ, *Pele Yoetz*):
- Traditional: "Wonderful Counselor"
- Alternative: "Messenger of Great Counsel"
- Alternative: "Wonderful in Counsel"

These variants demonstrate that while the traditional English translation "Mighty God" and "Everlasting Father" carry strong implications of divinity, the Hebrew allows for interpretations suggesting a mighty warrior empowered by God or a righteous king establishing an enduring dynasty.

## Fulfillment

### Jews

Jewish interpretation identifies the child in Isaiah 9:6 as either King Hezekiah or a future human Messiah. They never interpret this as God incarnate.

**King Hezekiah (Most Common View)**: [Rashi and Ibn Ezra](https://jewsforjudaism.org/knowledge/articles/who-is-the-child-in-isaiah-95-6) interpret this as a prophecy fulfilled in King Hezekiah. He reigned for 29 years (715-686 BC) and successfully defended Jerusalem against the Assyrian invasion (the immediate context of Isaiah 8-9). He brought peace to Judah. The name "Hezekiah" (*Chizkiyah*) means "God strengthens" or "Mighty is God," connecting to *El Gibbor* ("Mighty God"). Rashi notes that *olam* (translated "forever" in Isaiah 9:7) can mean "for all his life." Thus Hezekiah ruled in peace throughout his lifetime, not eternally.

**Future Messiah View**: The [Targum Jonathan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Targum_Jonathan) applies this text to the Messiah. However, the Messiah is understood as a human descendant of David who will restore Israel and establish justice, not as God incarnate.

**Rashi's Grammatical Parsing**: Rashi (and Ibn Ezra, Kimchi) understood the Hebrew verb וַיִּקְרָא (*vayikra*, "and he called") with God as the subject. In this reading, "the Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God, the Everlasting Father" (all titles referring to God) is the one who names the child "Prince of Peace" (the child's only title). This grammatical interpretation is supported by the Masoretic punctuation and avoids attributing divine titles to a human king.

**Theophoric Naming Convention**: Alternatively, some interpret the titles as theophoric names (names containing divine elements) that honor God without implying the person's divinity. Hebrew names frequently incorporate divine elements. Examples include:
- **Elijah** (אֵלִיָּהוּ, *Eliyahu*): "My God is Yahweh"
- **Immanuel** (עִמָּנוּאֵל, *Immanu'el*): "God with us"
- **Abi-ad** naming pattern: "Yahweh is his everlasting Father"

In this interpretive framework, **אֲבִיעַד** (*Avi-ad*, "Everlasting Father") would follow the same pattern as Elijah which is a name that honors God as the child's eternal Father, rather than claiming the child himself is God. Similarly, "Mighty God" (*El Gibbor*) describes the God who empowers and plans wonders for the king, rather than identifying the king as God Himself.

Another possibility is:

> In the culture of the Bible, anyone who began anything or was very important to something was called its "father." For example, because Jabal was the first one to live in a tent and raise livestock, the Bible says, "he was the father of those who live in tents and raise livestock" (Genesis 4:20). Furthermore, because Jubal was the first inventor of musical instruments, he is called, "the father of all who play the harp and flute" (Genesis 4:21).
>
> Scripture is not using "father" in the sense of literal father or ancestor in these verses, because both these men were descendants of Cain, and all their descendants died in the Flood. "Father" was being used in the cultural understanding of either one who was the first to do something or someone who was important in some way. Because the Messiah will be the one to establish the age to come, raise the dead into it, and rule over it, he is called "the father of the coming age."

### Christian

Traditional Christian interpretation sees Isaiah 9:6 as clear prophecy of Jesus Christ's divine nature and deity. The interpretation rests on several key arguments:

#### Divine Titles Transcending Humanity

The compound titles, particularly "Mighty God" (*El Gibbor*) and "Everlasting Father" (*Avi-ad*), are understood as unprecedented designations that transcend hyperbolic court language for human kings. Christians argue these titles can only truly apply to deity.

Significantly, the same title "Mighty God" (*El Gibbor*) appears in Isaiah 10:21 referring to Yahweh Himself: "A remnant will return, a remnant of Jacob, to the mighty God [*El Gibbor*]." If Isaiah uses this exact title for Yahweh elsewhere, its application to the child in 9:6 suggests divine identity. The phrase "Everlasting Father" (*Avi-ad*) implies eternal source of existence and sustainer of life—a role reserved exclusively for God.

However, some considerations complicate this interpretation. The term "el" appears for non-divine figures throughout Scripture—Moses is called "elohim" to Pharaoh (Exodus 7:1), and judges are termed "elohim" (Psalm 82:6)—suggesting the title may denote God-empowered authority rather than ontological deity. Similarly, "Father of the Coming Age" (*Avi-ad*) parallels Genesis 4:20-21, where Jabal is "father of tent-dwellers" and Jubal "father of musicians" without literal parentage—indicating "father" means "founder" or "inaugurator." Ancient Near Eastern throne names often incorporated divine elements to honor God's presence through the king. These titles may describe what God accomplishes *through* the Messiah rather than the Messiah's essential nature.

#### Jesus's Fulfillment of the Titles

Christians point to Jesus's life and claims as fulfilling these titles:

- **Government/authority** (Matthew 28:18): "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me"
- **Eternal kingdom** (Luke 1:33): "Of his kingdom there will be no end"
- **Wonderful Counselor**: Jesus's wisdom and teaching amazed audiences (Matthew 7:28-29)
- **Prince of Peace**: Jesus brings peace with God (Romans 5:1; John 14:27)

Yet Matthew 28:18 uses language of delegation—"All authority has been *given to me*"—rather than inherent divine sovereignty. The New Testament never quotes Isaiah 9:6 to prove Jesus's divinity, despite extensively citing Isaiah elsewhere. If this passage clearly demonstrated deity, its absence from apostolic arguments is noteworthy. Additionally, 1 Corinthians 15:24-28 describes Jesus handing the kingdom back to the Father and subordinating himself, suggesting functional rather than ontological equality.

#### Not Hezekiah

Christians argue the prophecy cannot refer to King Hezekiah for several reasons:

1. **Timing**: Isaiah's ministry began around 740 BC. The past tense "a child is born" would be premature if referring to Hezekiah, who was likely already born by that time.
2. **Unfulfilled Titles**: Scripture never applies these exalted titles—particularly "Mighty God" or "Everlasting Father"—to Hezekiah during his lifetime.
3. **Limited Kingdom**: 2 Kings 18:2 records that Hezekiah reigned only 29 years (715-686 BC), while Isaiah 9:7 promises a kingdom with "no end."

While these arguments effectively rule out Hezekiah, they demonstrate only that Isaiah prophesied a *future* Davidic king, not necessarily that this king must be ontologically divine. A human Messiah ruling with God-delegated authority could fulfill the endless kingdom prophecy through resurrection and eternal appointment, without requiring pre-existent deity.

#### Two-Stage Fulfillment and the Throne of David

Many Christians adopt a two-stage fulfillment framework:

1. **First Coming**: Jesus inaugurated God's kingdom spiritually (Mark 1:15), bringing peace with God through his sacrifice
2. **Second Coming**: Jesus will return to establish visible, universal peace (Isaiah 2:4, Revelation 21:4)

This framework addresses why the world still experiences conflict despite Jesus's first coming. The endless peace promised in Isaiah 9:7 awaits complete fulfillment at Christ's return.

However, Isaiah 9:7 explicitly states the child will sit "on the throne of David and over his kingdom"—a throne reserved for human Davidic descendants. Since God is sovereign over all creation, the text's explicit limitation to David's earthly throne raises questions about whether Isaiah envisioned God incarnate or a human king empowered by God. The phrase "a child is born" uses straightforward birth language without the incarnational framework later developed in Christian theology. Isaiah's 8th-century BC audience had no Trinitarian conceptual framework, raising questions about whether later theological developments are being read back into the prophet's original intent.

## Conclusion

**Debatable fulfillment**

The interpretation of Isaiah 9:6 depends significantly on one's hermeneutical approach and whether later theological frameworks are being applied to the original text.

Traditional Christian interpretation sees the divine titles as clear prophecy of Jesus's deity, with "Mighty God" (*El Gibbor*) and "Everlasting Father" (*Avi-ad*) pointing directly to his divine nature. This view emphasizes that the unprecedented compound titles transcend hyperbolic court language for human kings and can only truly apply to God incarnate. The citation of *El Gibbor* for Yahweh in Isaiah 10:21 strengthens this interpretation.

However, several considerations complicate this reading:

1. **Original Context**: Isaiah addressed 8th-century BC Judah facing Assyrian invasion (chapters 8-9), with verse 7 explicitly limiting the child to "the throne of David"—a human throne for Davidic descendants. The immediate shift to contemporary judgment (Isaiah 9:8ff) and the straightforward birth language ("a child is born") may suggest the original audience understood this as a promise of a divinely empowered human king rather than God incarnate.

2. **Linguistic Range**: Hebrew terms like "el" appear for non-divine figures (Moses as "elohim" in Exodus 7:1, judges as "elohim" in Psalm 82:6), and "father" frequently means "founder/establisher" (Genesis 4:20-21) rather than eternal source. The titles may legitimately describe functional authority delegated by God rather than ontological deity.

3. **New Testament Silence**: Despite extensively quoting Isaiah, Jesus and the apostles never cited Isaiah 9:6 to demonstrate Jesus's divinity. Matthew 28:18's language ("authority has been *given to me*") and 1 Corinthians 15:24-28 (Jesus subordinating himself to the Father and returning the kingdom) use language of delegation rather than ontological equality. Matthew's selective quotation of only Isaiah 9:1-2 (Matthew 4:14-16), while omitting verse 6, may suggest he did not view verse 6 as direct proof of deity.

4. **Hermeneutical Question**: The passage raises questions about whether Trinitarian theology—developed centuries after Isaiah through church councils—is being read back into the prophet's original intent, or whether Isaiah genuinely prophesied a concept that would have been incomprehensible to his original audience. Isaiah's contemporary audience had no framework for understanding [the Trinity](https://son.ofgod.info/trinity) as later defined, believing firmly that [God is One](https://son.ofgod.info/shema).

The interpretation ultimately depends on whether one sees the titles as ontological declarations of deity or as functional descriptions of God's work through an appointed human Messiah. Both the traditional Trinitarian view and alternative perspectives that emphasize delegated authority find textual support, making this a genuinely debatable fulfillment claim. While traditional Christian theology sees complete fulfillment in Christ's divinity, careful linguistic and contextual analysis suggests the passage may originally have described a righteous Davidic king empowered by God, with later typological application to Jesus as the ultimate fulfillment of the Davidic line—without necessarily proving his ontological equality with God.
