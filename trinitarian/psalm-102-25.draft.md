# You Laid the Foundation of the Earth

How can a prayer for help from a dying man be transformed into a proof of the Messiah's role in creating the universe? This fascinating shift occurs when the book of Hebrews quotes Psalm 102. By exploring the original lament and its later application, we can gain insight into the diverse ways theologians understand the nature of Jesus and his relationship to the Creator.

## The Original Lament in Psalm 102

Psalm 102 is traditionally categorized as a lament. It is a prayer of an afflicted person who is overwhelmed and pours out his complaint before the LORD (YHWH). The psalmist describes intense personal suffering and the fleeting nature of human life. However, he finds hope by contrasting his own mortality with the eternal and unchangeable nature of God.

> **Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry come to you!** Do not hide your face from me in the day of my distress! Incline your ear to me; answer me speedily in the day when I call! For my days pass away like smoke, and my bones burn like a furnace. My heart is struck down like grass and has withered; I forget to eat my bread. Because of my loud groaning my bones cling to my flesh... But you, **O LORD**, are enthroned forever; you are remembered throughout all generations. You will arise and have pity on Zion; it is the time to favor her; the appointed time has come... **Of old you laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They will perish, but you will remain; they will all wear out like a garment. You will change them like a robe, and they will pass away, but you are the same, and your years have no end.** The children of your servants shall dwell secure; their offspring shall be established before you. — Psalm 102:1-5,12-13,25-28 (ESV)

In its original context, the creation language in verses 25-27 highlights the unchangeable nature (immutability) of the LORD. While the heavens and earth are subject to change and decay, the Creator remains constant. This provides a firm foundation for the psalmist's hope. He believes that God will eventually restore Zion and provide security for future generations.

## Application to the Son in Hebrews 1

The author of the book of Hebrews uses this same passage to argue for the superiority of the Son over the angels. By quoting these verses, the author attributes the work of creation and the quality of eternal unchangeableness directly to Jesus Christ.

> But of the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions." And, **"You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the work of your hands; they will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment, like a robe you will roll them up, like a garment they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will have no end."** — Hebrews 1:8-12 (ESV)

## Theological Interpretations

Scholars and theologians have reached different conclusions regarding why and how this psalm is applied to Jesus.

### Trinitarian Perspective

Trinitarians generally view this application as a clear proof of the deity of Christ. They argue that the author of Hebrews intentionally identified Jesus with the LORD of the Old Testament. In this view, Jesus is the Creator who laid the foundation of the earth. He possesses the same eternal nature as the Father. This interpretation is supported by other New Testament passages that describe Jesus as the agent of creation. Examples include John 1:3; Colossians 1:16 (ESV). Supporting arguments can be found on sites like [BibleRef](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/1/Hebrews-1-10.html).

### Unitarian Perspectives

Unitarians often provide alternative explanations for this application. One common view is that the "heavens and earth" mentioned in Hebrews 1:10 refer to the "world to come" mentioned in Hebrews 2:5 (ESV). This refers to the new heavens and earth rather than the original creation in Genesis. In this framework, Jesus is the founder of the new creation or the Messianic age.

Another perspective is that the author of Hebrews is still addressing the Father in verses 10-12. The word "And" at the beginning of verse 10 connects back to the God mentioned in verse 9 who anointed the Son. The Father's unchangeable nature is cited as the guarantee that the Son's throne will be established forever. Further details on these views are available at [Biblical Unitarian](https://www.biblicalunitarian.com/verses/hebrews-1-10).

### Critical Perspective

Critical scholars often focus on the linguistic and textual factors. They note that the author of Hebrews relied on the Septuagint. This was the Greek translation of the Old Testament. The Septuagint includes the word *Kyrios* (Lord) in verse 25 of Psalm 101 (Psalm 102 in Hebrew). This word is not present in the Hebrew Masoretic Text. Since *Kyrios* was the primary title used for Jesus in the early church, this Greek phrasing made it easier to apply the text to him. Critical scholars may see this as a recontextualization. A prayer originally meant for God is repurposed for a high Christological argument.

## Scholarly Criticisms

Critics of the Trinitarian application point out that Psalm 102 is explicitly addressed to the LORD throughout the text. The psalmist begins with "Hear my prayer, O LORD" and maintains this focus. They argue that extracting verses 25–27 and applying them to a different figure ignores the surrounding lament context.

In response, defenders of the application argue that the New Testament authors often saw representative (typological) or anticipatory (proleptic) meanings in the Psalms. They believe the Holy Spirit inspired the author of Hebrews to reveal the hidden Messianic dimensions of the text. This means the Old Testament events and texts foreshadowed later events. From this perspective, the LORD's faithfulness to Zion in the psalm is ultimately fulfilled through the work of the Son.

## Conclusion

The use of Psalm 102:25-27 in Hebrews 1:10-12 remains a pivotal point of theological discussion. The original psalm is a [lament to the LORD](#the-original-lament-in-psalm-102) that finds comfort in God's eternal nature. The New Testament [application to the Son](#application-to-the-son-in-hebrews-1) serves to emphasize Jesus' superiority and creative role. While [Trinitarians](#trinitarian-perspective) see this as evidence of Christ's deity, [Unitarians](#unitarian-perspectives) and [critical scholars](#critical-perspective) suggest different reasons for the shift in focus. Ultimately, how one understands this passage depends on their [interpretive framework](#theological-interpretations) and their view of how the New Testament handles the Old Testament.
