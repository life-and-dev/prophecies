# You Laid the Foundation of the Earth

## The Prophecy

> **Hear my prayer, O LORD; let my cry come to you!** Do not hide your face from me in the day of my distress! Incline your ear to me; answer me speedily in the day when I call! For my days pass away like smoke, and my bones burn like a furnace. My heart is struck down like grass and has withered; I forget to eat my bread. Because of my loud groaning my bones cling to my skin... But you, **O LORD**, are enthroned forever; you are remembered throughout all generations. You will arise and have pity on Zion; it is the time to favor her; the appointed time has come... **Of old you laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands. They will perish, but you will remain; they will all wear out like a garment. You will change them like a robe, and they will pass away, but you are the same, and your years have no end.** The children of your servants shall dwell secure; their offspring shall be established before you. — Psalm 102:1-28 (ESV, selected verses)

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

The book of Hebrews quotes this psalm and applies it to the Son (Jesus):

> But of the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions." And, **"You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the work of your hands; they will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment, like a robe you will roll them up, like a garment they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will never end."** — Hebrews 1:8-12 (ESV)

### Christian

Christians interpret this as proving Jesus' divine nature, arguing that:

- Jesus is Creator who laid the foundation of the earth
- "You are the same, and your years will never end" demonstrates Jesus' eternality
- While creation changes and perishes, Jesus remains constant and unchangeable
- Only God creates, therefore Jesus must be God

The psalm is understood as prophesying the Messiah's role in creation and eternal divine nature.

However, several contextual factors challenge this interpretation:

1. **Psalm Explicitly Addresses YHWH (the LORD)**: The opening prayer states:
   > "**Hear my prayer, O LORD**; let my cry come to you!" (verse 1)

   Throughout the psalm, the psalmist directly addresses "the LORD" (YHWH):
   - "O LORD" (verse 1)
   - "But you, **O LORD**, are enthroned forever" (verse 12)
   - The creation language in verses 25-27 continues addressing "you, O LORD"

   This is a prayer **to** YHWH (God the Father), not a prophecy about a separate messianic figure.

2. **Context is Suffering Individual Crying to God**: The psalm's superscription identifies it as "A Prayer of one afflicted, when he is faint and pours out his complaint before the LORD." It describes an individual's lament seeking God's help:
   - "My days pass away like smoke" (verse 3)
   - "My bones burn like a furnace" (verse 3)
   - "I forget to eat my bread" (verse 4)
   - "My bones cling to my skin" (verse 5)

   This is personal suffering and prayer, not messianic prophecy.

3. **Creation Language Contrasts Psalmist's Mortality with God's Eternality**: The psalmist contrasts his fleeting life with God's eternal nature:
   - My days are fleeting (verses 3,11)
   - But **you**, O LORD, endure forever (verse 12)
   - Creation will perish, but **you** remain (verses 26-27)

   The contrast is between the frail, dying psalmist and the eternal God. The psalmist finds hope in God's unchanging nature despite personal suffering. This is not about the Messiah but about standard Old Testament theology of YHWH's eternality.

4. **Hebrews Changes Who Is Being Addressed**: Hebrews fundamentally reframes the speaker and audience:
   - **Psalm 102**: Psalmist prays **to** the LORD (YHWH): "Hear my prayer, O LORD"
   - **Hebrews 1**: Claims these verses are God speaking **to** the Son: "And [of the Son he says]"

   Hebrews transforms a prayer directed **to** God into God's words **about** the Son. This represents reinterpretation rather than the psalm's original meaning.

5. **Psalm Concerns God's Compassion on Zion**: Verses 13-22 focus on YHWH restoring Jerusalem/Zion:
   - "You will arise and have pity on Zion" (verse 13)
   - "Your servants hold her stones dear" (verse 14)
   - "The LORD builds up Zion; he appears in his glory" (verse 16)
   - "He regards the prayer of the destitute" (verse 17)

   The psalm's theme is God's faithfulness to restore Israel, providing hope to the suffering psalmist. This is not about the Messiah's creative power but about YHWH's covenant faithfulness.

6. **Creation Language is Standard Praise of YHWH**: Throughout the Old Testament, YHWH (God the Father) is consistently praised as Creator:
   - Genesis 1: God creates the heavens and earth
   - Psalm 104:2,5: "O LORD my God, you are very great!... you set the earth on its foundations"
   - Isaiah 40:28: "The LORD is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth"
   - Isaiah 42:5: "Thus says God, the LORD, who created the heavens and stretched them out"

   Attributing creation to YHWH was standard Jewish theology. Psalm 102 participates in this tradition of praising YHWH as Creator, not making a unique claim about the Messiah.

7. **No Messianic Indicators in Psalm**: Unlike genuinely messianic psalms (such as Psalm 110 or Psalm 2), Psalm 102 contains:
   - No reference to a king or anointed one (*mashiach*)
   - No mention of enemies being defeated or nations subdued
   - No royal or messianic imagery
   - Just a suffering individual praying to the eternal God for help and restoration

### Critical

Critical scholars view Psalm 102 as a lament psalm where a suffering individual prays to YHWH, contrasting their fleeting mortality with God's eternal unchanging nature. The psalmist seeks comfort in God's character and faithfulness to restore Zion. The creation language ("you laid the foundation of the earth") represents standard Old Testament praise of YHWH as Creator, found throughout Scripture. Hebrews applies these verses to Jesus as part of its theological argument that the Son shares the Father's divine nature and is superior to angels. However, this requires reframing a prayer **to** YHWH as words **about** the Son, extracting verses from their lament context, and reading trinitarian theology into a monotheistic prayer. The original psalm addresses YHWH exclusively.

## Conclusion

**Decontextualized fulfillment.** Psalm 102 is a lament psalm where a suffering individual prays to YHWH (the LORD), contrasting their fleeting life with God's eternal nature. The psalm opens with "Hear my prayer, O LORD" and consistently addresses YHWH throughout. The creation language ("of old you laid the foundation of the earth") represents standard Old Testament praise of YHWH as Creator, part of the psalmist's argument: "I'm dying, but you're eternal; creation will pass away, but you remain—therefore, please help me and restore Zion." The psalm's theme is finding hope in YHWH's unchanging character and covenant faithfulness to restore Jerusalem. Hebrews applies verses 25-27 to the Son as part of its theological argument for Christ's deity, but this requires reframing a prayer directed **to** YHWH as God's words **about** the Son, extracting verses from their lament context, and treating standard YHWH creation language as messianic prophecy. No Old Testament author identifies this as messianic prophecy. The passage must be extracted from its context as an individual's prayer to YHWH to apply it to Jesus.
