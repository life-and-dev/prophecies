# Psalm 2 (God's Son)

## The Prophecy

> I will tell of the decree:
> the LORD said to me, “You are my Son; **today I have begotten you**.
> Ask of me, and I will make the nations your heritage, and the ends of the earth your possession. You shall break them with a rod of iron and dash them in pieces like a potter's vessel.”
> Now therefore, O kings, be wise; be warned, O rulers of the earth.
> Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
> Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and you perish in the way, for his wrath is quickly kindled. — Psalm 2:7-12 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### God

God Himself publicly declared Jesus as His Son:

> And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; and behold, **a voice from heaven said, "This is My beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased."** — Matthew 3:16-17 (ESV)

> And a cloud overshadowed them, and **a voice came out of the cloud, "This is My beloved Son; listen to him."** — Mark 9:7 (ESV)

### Apostles

Paul's sermon in Pisidian Antioch explicitly connected this to Jesus' resurrection:

> So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said: ...
> We bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, this **He has fulfilled to us** their children **by raising Jesus**, as also **it is written in the second Psalm**,
> "You are My Son, today I have begotten you." — Acts 13:16, 32-33 (ESV)

The author of Hebrews also applies this passage to Jesus:

> For to which of the angels did God ever say, **"You are my Son, today I have begotten you"**? Or again, "I will be to him a father, and he shall be to Me a son"? — Hebrews 1:5 (ESV)

> So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by him who said to him, **"You are My Son, today I have begotten you"**; as He says also in another place, "You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek." — Hebrews 5:5-6 (ESV)

### Christian

Christians believe Jesus fulfilled this prophecy as God's unique divine Son, arguing that:

**Prophetic Past Tense**: It is a common prophetic literary device to refer to future events in the past tense as if they have already occurred. For example, Isaiah 53 uses past tense to describe the Messiah's suffering long before it happened:

> Surely he **has borne** our griefs and **carried** our sorrows;
> yet we **esteemed** him stricken, smitten by God, and **afflicted**. But he **was pierced** for our transgressions; he **was crushed** for our iniquities; upon him was the chastisement that **brought** us peace, and with his wounds we are healed. — Isaiah 53:3 (ESV)

**Interpretation of "today"**: The Hebrew word "yom," translated as "today," does not exclusively refer to the day the Psalm was written. It can also signify "a specific future day, later, some time, when, whenever." In this context, it points to the day of Jesus' resurrection (Acts 13:33).

**Distinction between YHVH and His Son**: Psalm 2 clearly depicts an interaction between "The LORD" (YHVH) and "His Son," indicating they are distinct entities. This clarifies potential confusion for those who might equate "the Lord" solely with Jesus. The core message is that YHVH "begot" a Son, the Son inherits from YHVH, rules with a "rod of iron," and is to be honored ("Kiss the Son").

**Paul's Explicit Application**: Paul directly applies Psalm 2:7 to Jesus' resurrection (Acts 13:33). Through resurrection, Jesus was "declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness" (Romans 1:4). The "begetting" refers to resurrection—divine validation and declaration of Jesus as God's Son in power.

**God's Unprecedented Declarations**: God publicly declared Jesus "my beloved Son" at His baptism (Matthew 3:17) and transfiguration (Matthew 17:5; Mark 9:7)—unprecedented affirmation not given to any other individual in Scripture. This demonstrates unique Sonship beyond the metaphorical "son of God" language sometimes applied to Davidic kings or Israel collectively.

**Hebrews' Unique Sonship**: Hebrews 1:5 contrasts Jesus with angels, emphasizing His unique Sonship: "For to which of the angels did God ever say, 'You are my Son'?" Hebrews 1:3 describes Jesus as "the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature"—indicating divine nature, not merely a title of honor.

**Progressive Fulfillment of Nations**: Jesus declared, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me" (Matthew 28:18). The Great Commission ("make disciples of all nations," Matthew 28:19) represents the process of receiving the nations as inheritance. Christianity has spread to every continent and nation—billions worship Jesus across all peoples. While not yet universal, the scope is unprecedented in human history. Full visible dominion over all nations awaits the second coming (Revelation 11:15: "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ").

However, whether Psalm 2 originally prophesied divine messianic Sonship is disputed:

### Jews

**Debated whether messianic.** Jewish scholars offer various interpretations:

1. **King David or Solomon**: Many Jewish commentators view this as describing David's or Solomon's coronation. "You are my Son" represents adoption language—God declaring the Davidic king as His representative and anointed ruler, not literal divine sonship. Ancient Near Eastern kings commonly used "son of god" language metaphorically to indicate divine appointment and authority.

2. **Future Messiah as Human King**: Some rabbinic sources do apply this psalm to the future Messiah, but emphasize "Son" as a title of honor and authority, not deity. The Messiah will be fully human, a righteous descendant of David who restores Israel's kingdom. The sonship language indicates special relationship and divine appointment, not divine nature.

3. **Coronation Context**: "Today I have begotten you" refers to the day of coronation when the king assumes office, not biological birth or resurrection. In ancient coronation ceremonies, the king was symbolically "born" into his royal office and adopted as God's son. Christians' application to Jesus' resurrection is seen as reading later theological meaning into the text (eisegesis) rather than deriving meaning from the text's original context (exegesis).

4. **Inheritance Not Yet Realized**: The psalm promises "the nations as your heritage" and rule "to the ends of the earth." Jewish scholars argue Jesus never received visible dominion over all nations. The Messiah should establish a visible political kingdom ruling from Jerusalem with all nations acknowledging his authority. Spiritual influence or progressive fulfillment does not satisfy the psalm's plain meaning of actual political dominion.

5. **"Kiss the Son" Translation Disputed**: The Hebrew phrase traditionally translated "Kiss the Son" (*nashqu bar*) mixes Hebrew (*nashqu* = kiss) with Aramaic (*bar* = son). Some scholars translate it differently, such as "do homage with purity" or "kiss his feet," avoiding the direct "Kiss the Son" reading that Christians emphasize.

### Critical

Critical scholars view Psalm 2 as a royal coronation psalm used in ancient Israel's enthronement ceremonies. The "son of God" language reflects ancient Near Eastern royal ideology where kings were considered divinely appointed representatives. "Today I have begotten you" refers to the coronation day when the king symbolically entered his royal office. The psalm's original function was liturgical—celebrating and legitimizing Davidic kings' rule over Israel and expressing hope for expanded dominion. Paul and Hebrews later applied this psalm to Jesus using midrashic interpretation, seeing deeper messianic meaning, but this represents theological development rather than the psalm's original prophetic intent.

## Conclusion

**Debatable fulfillment.** Paul explicitly applied Psalm 2:7 to Jesus' resurrection (Acts 13:33; Romans 1:4), and Hebrews emphasizes Jesus' unique Sonship contrasted with angels (Hebrews 1:5). God's public declarations of Jesus as "my beloved Son" at His baptism and transfiguration are unprecedented in Scripture. Christians point to the spread of Christianity across all nations as progressive fulfillment of the "nations as your heritage" promise, with full visible dominion awaiting the second coming. However, the interpretation depends on fundamental questions: whether "Son" indicates metaphorical divine appointment (Jewish view) or unique divine Sonship (Christian view), whether "begotten" refers to coronation ceremony or resurrection, and whether the inheritance of nations requires visible political dominion or can be progressively/spiritually fulfilled. The original context suggests a royal coronation psalm using language common in ancient Near Eastern royal ideology. Jewish scholars view this as addressing Davidic kings generally (with possible future messianic application maintaining full humanity), while Christians see it as prophesying Jesus' divine Sonship revealed through resurrection. The visible inheritance of nations remains incomplete by any standard, requiring belief in eschatological future fulfillment.
