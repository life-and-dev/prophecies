# Lift Up Your Heads, O Gates

## The Prophecy

> The earth is the LORD's and the fullness thereof, the world and those who dwell therein, for he has founded it upon the seas and established it upon the rivers. Who shall ascend the hill of the LORD? And who shall stand in his holy place? He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to what is false and does not swear deceitfully. **Lift up your heads, O gates! And be lifted up, O ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. Who is this King of glory? The LORD, strong and mighty, the LORD, mighty in battle!** Lift up your heads, O gates! And lift them up, O ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in. **Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King of glory!** — Psalm 24:1-10 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian

Christians interpret this psalm as referring to Jesus, arguing that:

- "King of glory" refers to Jesus entering Jerusalem during His triumphal entry
- "Lift up your heads, O gates" describes Jesus' entrance into Jerusalem
- "Ancient doors" or "everlasting doors" refers to the gates of heaven opening for Jesus' ascension
- "Mighty in battle" points to Jesus' victory over sin and death through crucifixion and resurrection
- "LORD of hosts" identifies Jesus as divine King, equating Him with YHWH

The psalm is understood as prophesying either Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem or His ascension into heaven where heavenly gates open to receive Him.

However, several contextual factors challenge this interpretation:

1. **Psalm Explicitly Identifies King of Glory as YHWH**: The text provides its own answer to the question "Who is this King of glory?" twice:
   - "Who is this King of glory? **The LORD**, strong and mighty, the LORD, mighty in battle"
   - "Who is this King of glory? **The LORD of hosts**, he is the King of glory"

   The psalm explicitly identifies the King of glory as YHWH (the LORD) and uses the divine title "LORD of hosts" (*YHWH Sabaoth*). This is about God Himself, not a separate messianic figure. Applying this to Jesus requires identifying Jesus with YHWH, which moves the discussion into trinitarian theology rather than straightforward messianic prophecy.

2. **"Everlasting Doors" Don't Match Jerusalem's Literal Gates**: The phrase "ancient doors" or "everlasting doors" (Hebrew: *pitchei olam*) suggests eternal, timeless gates. Jerusalem's literal city gates were:
   - Built in historical time
   - Destroyed and rebuilt multiple times throughout history
   - Not "everlasting" in any sense

   The language is poetic and symbolic, not describing literal physical gates of a historical city.

3. **Historical Context—Bringing the Ark to Jerusalem**: Many scholars believe this psalm was composed for the occasion when David brought the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem (2 Samuel 6). The Ark represented God's physical presence among Israel, so the psalm celebrates YHWH's entrance into His city. This was a specific historical liturgical event, not a prophecy about future events.

4. **Liturgical Processional Psalm**: The structure suggests this was used in worship processions:
   - First section: Hymn to God as creator (verses 1-2)
   - Second section: Entrance liturgy asking who may enter God's presence (verses 3-6)
   - Third section: Antiphonal call for gates to open for God (verses 7-10)

   The call-and-response format indicates liturgical use, with priests or Levites calling from outside the gates while others respond from inside. This is temple worship liturgy, not prophecy.

5. **Jesus' Entry Into Jerusalem Doesn't Match**: When Jesus entered Jerusalem during what Christians call the triumphal entry:
   - He rode a donkey in fulfillment of Zechariah 9:9 (Matthew 21:1-11)
   - People shouted "Hosanna" and spread cloaks and palm branches
   - No mention of gates lifting up or ancient doors opening
   - He was rejected by Jerusalem's leaders, not welcomed as "King of glory"
   - He wept over Jerusalem, knowing it would be destroyed (Luke 19:41-44)

   The triumphal entry narrative does not contain the imagery of Psalm 24. The gates did not lift up to welcome Him; instead, He was crucified outside the city walls.

6. **Emphasizes God's Sovereignty Over Creation**: The opening verses establish that "the earth is the LORD's and the fullness thereof" because He founded and established it upon the seas and rivers. This is about the creator God entering His own sanctuary, celebrating His sovereignty over all creation. The context is divine lordship over the cosmos, not a human Messiah entering a city.

7. **"LORD of Hosts" is Divine Title**: The title *YHWH Sabaoth* (LORD of hosts/armies) refers to God commanding the heavenly armies. It is a title of divine sovereignty used throughout the Old Testament exclusively for God Himself, not for a human messiah. Using this title reinforces that the psalm celebrates YHWH's entrance, not a separate messianic figure.

### Critical

Critical scholars view Psalm 24 as a liturgical processional psalm used in Israelite worship, likely composed for bringing the Ark of the Covenant to Jerusalem. The psalm celebrates YHWH (the LORD) entering His sanctuary, with the call-and-response format suggesting antiphonal singing during temple processions. The "everlasting doors" represent poetic, symbolic language for God's dwelling place, not literal city gates. The psalm explicitly identifies the "King of glory" as "the LORD" and "the LORD of hosts"—divine titles for YHWH. The psalm's original function was liturgical worship celebrating God's presence, not prophesying a future Messiah.

## Conclusion

**Decontextualized fulfillment.** Psalm 24 is a liturgical processional psalm celebrating YHWH (the LORD) entering Jerusalem, likely composed for when David brought the Ark of the Covenant to the city (2 Samuel 6). The psalm explicitly answers its own question "Who is this King of glory?" by identifying Him as "the LORD, strong and mighty" and "the LORD of hosts"—divine titles for YHWH Himself. The structure indicates liturgical use with call-and-response format during worship processions. The "everlasting doors" or "ancient doors" represent poetic, symbolic language that doesn't match Jerusalem's literal historical gates, which were destroyed and rebuilt multiple times. The opening verses establish the context as celebrating God's sovereignty over all creation as its founder. Jesus' triumphal entry into Jerusalem does not contain the imagery of Psalm 24—no gates lifted up, no ancient doors opened, and He was rejected rather than welcomed as King of glory. Applying this psalm to Jesus requires identifying Him with YHWH, moving the discussion into trinitarian theology rather than straightforward messianic prophecy. No Old Testament author identifies this as messianic prophecy. The passage must be extracted from its liturgical context celebrating YHWH's entrance to apply it to Jesus.
