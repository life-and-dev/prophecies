# Your Throne, O God, Is Forever

## The Prophecy

Psalm 45 is a royal wedding song:

> My heart overflows with a pleasing theme; I address my verses to the king; my tongue is like the pen of a ready scribe. You are the most handsome of the sons of men; grace is poured upon your lips; therefore God has blessed you forever.
>
> Gird your sword on your thigh, O mighty one, in your splendor and majesty! In your majesty ride out victoriously for the cause of truth and meekness and righteousness...
>
> **Your throne, O God, is forever and ever. The scepter of your kingdom is a scepter of uprightness; you have loved righteousness and hated wickedness. Therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions;** your robes are all fragrant with myrrh and aloes and cassia.
>
> From ivory palaces stringed instruments make you glad; **daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor; at your right hand stands the queen in gold of Ophir.**
>
> Hear, O daughter, and consider, and incline your ear: forget your people and your father's house, and the king will desire your beauty. Since he is your lord, bow to him. **The people of Tyre will seek your favor with gifts**, the richest of the people.
>
> **In place of your fathers shall be your sons; you will make them princes in all the earth.** I will cause your name to be remembered in all generations; therefore nations will praise you forever and ever. — Psalm 45:1-17 (selected verses, ESV)

### Apostles

The book of Hebrews quotes this psalm and applies it to Jesus:

> But of the Son he says, "**Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom. You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions.**" — Hebrews 1:8-9 (ESV)

Christians interpret this as:
- **"Your throne, O God"** - Jesus' divine nature
- **"Forever and ever"** - Jesus' eternal kingship
- **"Anointed... with the oil of gladness"** - Jesus as the Anointed One (Messiah)
- **"Loved righteousness and hated wickedness"** - Jesus' perfect moral character

The psalm is understood as prophesying the Messiah's divinity and eternal reign.

## Original Context

### Why This Is Misunderstood

1. **The superscription labels it a wedding song**: The heading reads "To the choirmaster: according to Lilies. A Maskil of the Sons of Korah; **a love song**." This is explicitly a royal wedding celebration, not a messianic prophecy.

2. **The king is described as exceptionally handsome**: Verse 2 says, "You are **the most handsome** of the sons of men; **grace is poured upon your lips**." This contradicts Isaiah's description of the Messiah:
   > He had no form or majesty that we should look at him, and **no beauty that we should desire him**. — Isaiah 53:2 (ESV)

   Jesus, according to Christian interpretation of Isaiah 53, had no exceptional physical beauty. Psalm 45 celebrates a king renowned for his handsomeness.

3. **The psalm mentions the king's bride**: Verses 9-15 extensively describe the king's wedding:
   - "Daughters of kings are among your ladies of honor"
   - "At your right hand stands the **queen** in gold of Ophir"
   - Instructions to the bride about forgetting her father's house
   - "The king will desire your beauty"

   Jesus never married. Christians don't interpret these verses literally about Jesus, showing they recognize the earthly context.

4. **The bride is from Tyre**: Verse 12 says, "The people of **Tyre** will seek your favor with gifts." Tyre was a Phoenician coastal city. This suggests the bride or the wedding involves Tyrian connections—a specific historical detail, not a messianic prophecy.

5. **The king will have sons who become princes**: Verse 16 says, "**In place of your fathers shall be your sons**; you will make them **princes** in all the earth." This describes:
   - The king having biological children
   - Those sons succeeding their father as rulers
   - A continuing dynasty

   Jesus had no biological children and his kingdom is not passed down through hereditary succession.

6. **The psalm mentions "your fathers"**: Verse 16 refers to "your fathers," indicating the king has ancestral fathers. While Jesus had human ancestry, this verse discusses replacing the king's fathers with his own sons—a dynastic succession pattern.

7. **"O God" (Elohim) can mean "divine one" or royal address**: The Hebrew *Elohim* in "Your throne, O God" is sometimes translated "Your throne, O divine one" or even "Your throne is God's throne" or "God is your throne." In ancient Near Eastern royal language, kings were sometimes addressed with elevated titles. Even if "God" is the right translation, it may be royal court hyperbole, not literal divinity.

8. **The king has a God above him**: Verse 7 says, "Therefore **God, your God**, has anointed you." If the king addressed as "O God" in verse 6 had a God above him who anointed him, he's not the supreme deity. This fits a human king, not the divine Messiah.

## Conclusion

**Misunderstood context.** Psalm 45 is a royal wedding song celebrating an Israelite king's marriage. The superscription explicitly identifies it as "a love song." The psalm contains numerous earthly details incompatible with Jesus:
- Exceptional physical handsomeness (contradicts Isaiah 53:2)
- Taking a queen/bride
- Bride from Tyre
- Having biological sons who become princes
- Mention of the king's fathers

While the psalm uses elevated language ("Your throne, O God"), this is royal court language in the context of a specific historical wedding, not a prophecy. The king is both called "O God" and has "God, your God" above him, suggesting the title is honorific, not literal.

The Christian interpretation depends on:
- Extracting two verses (6-7) while ignoring the wedding context
- Disregarding the psalm's explicit label as "a love song"
- Spiritualizing the bride, sons, and earthly details that don't fit Jesus
- Overlooking that the king's physical beauty contradicts Isaiah 53's description of the Messiah
- Treating royal court hyperbole as prophecy of divine Messiah
