# God Has Gone Up with a Shout

## The Prophecy

> Clap your hands, all peoples! Shout to God with loud songs of joy! For **the LORD, the Most High, is awesome, a great King over all the earth.** He subdued peoples under us, and nations under our feet. He chose our heritage for us, the pride of Jacob whom he loves. **God has gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet.** Sing praises to God, sing praises! Sing praises to our King, sing praises! For God is the King of all the earth; sing praises with a psalm! **God reigns over the nations; God sits on his holy throne.** The princes of the peoples gather as the people of the God of Abraham. For the shields of the earth belong to God; **he is highly exalted!** — Psalm 47:1-9 (ESV)

## Fulfillment

### Christian

Christians sometimes interpret this psalm as referring to Jesus, arguing that:

- "God has gone up" refers to Jesus' ascension to heaven (Acts 1:9-11)
- "With the sound of a trumpet" describes triumphant ascension or second coming
- "King over all the earth" points to Jesus' ultimate reign over all nations
- "Sits on his holy throne" describes Jesus seated at God's right hand
- "Highly exalted" refers to Jesus' exaltation after resurrection (Philippians 2:9)

The psalm is understood as prophesying the Messiah's ascension and enthronement in heaven.

However, several contextual factors challenge this interpretation:

1. **Psalm Explicitly Addresses YHWH**: Throughout the psalm, "the LORD" (YHWH), "God" (Elohim), and "Most High" (Elyon) all refer to God the Father, not a separate messianic figure. The psalm celebrates God Himself, not someone else. Every reference points to YHWH as the subject being praised.

2. **God Doesn't Exalt Himself**: The psalm states "**he is highly exalted**" (verse 9). In Christian theology, God the Father exalted Jesus (Philippians 2:9: "Therefore God has highly exalted him"; Acts 2:33: "Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God"). But God the Father does not exalt Himself—He is inherently supreme. The psalm's statement makes sense for God's reputation being elevated among the nations, not for God exalting Himself to a higher position.

3. **Monotheistic Context**: A Jewish audience reading "the LORD Most High" being "highly exalted" would not think of one person of a Trinity exalting another. They understood YHWH as one indivisible God. The language means God's reputation and recognition among nations is elevated, not divine ascension or one divine person exalting another.

4. **"God Has Gone Up" Refers to Temple Procession**: Verse 5 states "God has gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a trumpet." This likely refers to:
   - Liturgical processions where the Ark of the Covenant (representing God's presence) was carried up to the temple on Mount Zion
   - Celebration of God's symbolic enthronement in worship
   - God dwelling on Mount Zion (Jerusalem), the "holy mountain"

   This is temple worship imagery common in Israel's liturgy, not prophecy of physical ascension to heaven.

5. **"Exalted" Means Increased Recognition Among Nations**: The psalm celebrates how God "subdued peoples under us, and nations under our feet" (verse 3) and how "the princes of the peoples gather as the people of the God of Abraham" (verse 9). God's "exaltation" refers to:
   - His reputation spreading among gentile nations
   - Nations recognizing His sovereignty
   - His fame and glory increasing throughout the earth

   This is about God's glory being acknowledged universally, not about ascension to a higher position.

6. **Past Tense Celebrates Historical Victories**: "He subdued peoples under us, and nations under our feet" (verse 3). This celebrates Israel's historical military victories over surrounding nations, attributing them to God's power. It is thanksgiving for what God already accomplished through Israel's conquests, not future prophecy.

7. **Corporate Worship Context**: The psalm calls "all peoples" to "clap your hands" and "shout to God with loud songs of joy" (verse 1). Commands like "Sing praises to God, sing praises!" (verse 6) show this is a liturgical hymn for communal worship, celebrating God's ongoing reign over the nations. This is corporate praise, not prophecy about a future event.

8. **No Messianic Indicators**: The psalm contains no reference to:
   - A coming anointed one (*mashiach*)
   - A Davidic king
   - Future salvation or redemption
   - Suffering and vindication

   It simply celebrates YHWH's present sovereignty over all nations.

### Critical

Critical scholars view Psalm 47 as an enthronement hymn celebrating YHWH's kingship over all nations. The language of God "going up" refers to liturgical temple processions, particularly those involving the Ark of the Covenant ascending to Mount Zion. The psalm's call for all peoples to praise God reflects Israel's theology of YHWH as universal sovereign. "Highly exalted" refers to God's glory and reputation increasing among the nations as they recognize His supremacy. The psalm functions as corporate worship celebrating God's ongoing reign, not prophesying future messianic events. Applying this to Jesus' ascension requires reading trinitarian theology into a monotheistic worship hymn.

## Conclusion

**Decontextualized fulfillment.** Psalm 47 is a liturgical hymn celebrating YHWH as King over all the earth, calling all peoples to praise God for His sovereignty. The psalm consistently addresses YHWH directly throughout, using titles like "the LORD," "the Most High," and "God." The phrase "God has gone up with a shout" refers to liturgical temple processions where the Ark of the Covenant (representing God's presence) was carried up to Mount Zion, accompanied by shouts and trumpet blasts. "Highly exalted" describes God's reputation and recognition increasing among the nations as they acknowledge His sovereignty, not God exalting Himself to a higher position (which would be theologically nonsensical—God is already supreme). In monotheistic Jewish understanding, one indivisible God does not exalt Himself. The psalm celebrates historical victories God gave Israel ("He subdued peoples under us") in past tense. The entire context is corporate worship celebrating God's present ongoing reign. No Old Testament author identifies this as messianic prophecy. Applying this to Jesus' ascension requires reading trinitarian theology (Father exalting Son) into a text written for monotheistic worship of the one God (YHWH).
