# Worship Him, All You Gods

## The Prophecy

> The LORD reigns, let the earth rejoice; let the many coastlands be glad! Clouds and thick darkness are all around him; righteousness and justice are the foundation of his throne. Fire goes before him and burns up his adversaries all around. His lightnings light up the world; the earth sees and trembles. The mountains melt like wax before the LORD, before the Lord of all the earth. The heavens proclaim his righteousness, and all the peoples see his glory. All worshipers of images are put to shame, who make their boast in worthless idols; **worship him, all you gods!** Zion hears and is glad, and the daughters of Judah rejoice, because of your judgments, O LORD. For you, O LORD, are most high over all the earth; you are exalted far above all gods. — Psalm 97:1-9 (ESV, selected verses)

## Fulfillment

### Apostles

The book of Hebrews quotes this psalm and applies it to Jesus at His incarnation:

> And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says, **"Let all God's angels worship him."** — Hebrews 1:6 (ESV)

### Christian

Christians interpret this passage as proving Jesus' divine status, arguing that:

- The command for angels to worship demonstrates Jesus shares divine nature
- The title "firstborn" indicates Jesus' preeminence and deity
- Worship is due only to God, therefore Jesus must be God

The passage is understood as prophesying that angels would worship the Messiah, establishing His equality with the Father.

However, several contextual factors challenge this interpretation:

1. **The Entire Psalm Addresses YHWH**: Throughout Psalm 97, the subject is consistently identified as "the LORD" (YHWH):
   - "**The LORD** reigns" (verse 1)
   - "Before **the LORD**, before **the Lord of all the earth**" (verse 5)
   - "Because of your judgments, **O LORD**" (verse 8)
   - "For you, **O LORD**, are most high over all the earth" (verse 9)

   The psalm celebrates YHWH (traditionally understood as God the Father), not a separate messianic figure.

2. **Immediate Context**: The command "worship him, all you gods" (verse 7) follows directly after describing YHWH's glory, power, and judgments. The pronoun "him" refers to "the LORD" mentioned throughout the surrounding verses. Ancient translations render the Hebrew *elohim* as "angels," but regardless of translation, they are commanded to worship YHWH.

3. **Jesus' Teaching on Worship**: When confronted by Satan's temptation, Jesus declared:

   > "Be gone, Satan! For it is written, '**You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.**'" — Matthew 4:10 (ESV)

   Jesus directed worship exclusively to "the Lord your God" (the Father). He did not claim such worship for himself but consistently redirected it to the Father.

4. **Jesus' Consistent Pattern**: Throughout His earthly ministry, Jesus:
   - Prayed to the Father (Matthew 6:9)
   - Affirmed "the Father is greater than I" (John 14:28)
   - Directed glory to the Father (John 17:1-5)
   - Called the Father "my God" even after resurrection (John 20:17)

   Jesus' pattern was directing worship and honor to the Father, not claiming the kind of universal worship described in this psalm.

5. **Hebrews' Interpretive Method**: Hebrews 1:6 does not claim Psalm 97 originally prophesied the Messiah. The book of Hebrews employs a midrashic interpretive method, applying Old Testament texts about God to Christ to construct a theological argument for Christ's deity. This represents theological interpretation rather than claiming the psalm's original prophetic intent was messianic.

6. **The Psalm's Theme**: Psalm 97 celebrates YHWH's sovereign reign with cosmic imagery:
   - Mountains melt before Him (verse 5)
   - The earth trembles (verse 4)
   - He is "exalted far above all gods" (verse 9)
   - Fire goes before Him, consuming His adversaries (verse 3)

   This is theophany—God revealing His glory and majesty. The psalm does not describe a future Messiah but celebrates God's present supreme sovereignty.

7. **Monotheistic Context**: For the original Jewish audience, this psalm celebrated the one true God (YHWH) in stark contrast to pagan idols and false gods. The command for angels and spiritual beings (*elohim*) to worship YHWH emphasizes His uniqueness and supremacy as the only true God. Reading this as worship of a second distinct divine person was not the original intent within ancient Israel's strict monotheistic framework.

### Critical

Critical scholars view Psalm 97 as a hymn celebrating YHWH's sovereign reign over all creation, firmly rooted in Israelite monotheism. The psalm consistently identifies its subject as "the LORD" (YHWH) and calls all beings to worship Him because of His supreme majesty. The application in Hebrews represents later theological development rather than the psalm's original prophetic intent. Reading Trinitarian theology into a monotheistic psalm requires extracting phrases from their literary and historical context.

## Conclusion

**Decontextualized fulfillment.** Psalm 97 is a hymn celebrating YHWH's sovereign reign over all creation, calling all beings including angels to worship Him because of His supreme majesty and power. The psalm consistently identifies its subject as "the LORD" (YHWH) throughout, employing cosmic imagery to celebrate God's theophany and unique sovereignty. While Hebrews applies this passage to Jesus as part of its theological argument for Christ's deity using midrashic interpretation, the original psalm does not distinguish between Father and Son but celebrates the one God of Israel within a strictly monotheistic framework. No Old Testament author identifies this as messianic prophecy, and Jesus himself taught that worship belongs exclusively to "the Lord your God" (Matthew 4:10). The passage must be extracted from its monotheistic context to apply it as prophecy of a separate divine figure worthy of worship.
